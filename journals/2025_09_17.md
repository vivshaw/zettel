	- >[...] unreasonable, irresponsible politicians and their supporters do not only sin against those who suffer under their malign policies (to whom we will return in a moment), but also and in the first place against their own nature. They have put their light of reason under a bushel and foresworn the dignity proper to responsible freedom. But we may only read these sins as sins if the light is not thereby extinguished, nor dignity expunged. By acting as though the light has gone out and dignity forever lost, the agonist at once takes an absurdity for a fact and, ironically, implodes the moral scaffold they presumed to have ascended.
