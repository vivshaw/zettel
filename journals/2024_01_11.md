	- > *The simultaneous borrowing of French and Latin words led to a highly distinctive feature of modern English vocabulary: sets of three items, all expressing the same fundamental notion but differing slightly in meaning or style, e.g., kingly, royal, regal; rise, mount, ascend; ask, question, interrogate; fast, firm, secure; holy, sacred, consecrated. The Old English word (the first in each triplet) is the most colloquial, the French (the second) is more literary, and the Latin word (the last) more learned.”*

	- > *But language tends not to do what we want it to. The die was cast: English had thousands of new words competing with native English words for the same things. One result was triplets allowing us to express ideas with varying degrees of formality. **Help** is English, **aid** is French, **assist** is Latin. Or, **kingly** is English, **royal** is French, **regal** is Latin – note how one imagines posture improving with each level: **kingly** sounds almost mocking, **regal** is straight-backed like a throne, **royal** is somewhere in the middle, a worthy but fallible monarch.*

	- I agree wholeheartedly- nice to see I'm not the only one, and that there are decent typographic _reasons_ to think so as well
