- > The moment of the rose and the moment of the yew-tree
  Are of equal duration. A people without history
  Is not redeemed from time, for history is a pattern
  Of timeless moments. So, while the light fails
  On a winter's afternoon, in a secluded chapel
  History is now and England.
  *"Little Gidding"*, T.S. Eliot
