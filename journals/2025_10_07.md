- Simon Willison on [letting the LLM write the prompt](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/4/drew-on-dspy/) with [DSPy](https://dspy.ai/) #AI #LLM #[[prompt engineering]]
	- > Why bother? Drew points out that having a prompt optimization pipeline makes it trivial to evaluate and switch to other models if they can score higher with a custom optimized prompt - without needing to execute that trial-and-error optimization by hand.
	- TODO play with this!
