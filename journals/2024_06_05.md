- Hillel Wayne on doing interesting [crimes with Python's pattern matching](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/python-abc/) #python #[[cursed code]] #metaprogramming #OO #[[pattern matching]]
	- > We can still have fun with side effects, though. This ABC lets through every-other type.
	- ```Python
	  class FlipFlop(ABC):
	      flag = False
	  
	      @classmethod
	      def __subclasshook__(cls, _):
	          cls.flag = not cls.flag
	          return cls.flag
	  ```
	- > And this ABC asks the user what it should do for each type.
	- ```Python
	  class Ask(ABC):
	      first_class = None
	  
	      @classmethod
	      def __subclasshook__(cls, C):
	          choice = input(f"hey should I let {C} though [y/n]  ")
	          if choice == 'y':
	              print("okay we'll pass em through")
	              return True
	          return False
	  ```
	- > Try them in a pattern match. They both work!
