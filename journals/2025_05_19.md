	- > This is Smalltalk 80, it is 12 kb of code. In the Blue Book they say it takes "one staff year of work" to implement. When talking about scale complexity, saying that something takes "one staff year of work" is an index of scale that is tangible. I wondered, if it's a year's worth of work to implement Smalltalk, then, what is a "one week computer", or a "one month computer."
	- > There's a big war going on at the top, people are trying to find the one thing that will work. In permacomputing, people are not looking for one solution, a good solution involves interactions between many things. The resilience of a garden, or a farm, is about interdependence. Companion planting is when two plants are grown near each other to benefit one of those plants, by fending off insects, for example. What is ideal is an ecosystem of many solutions. Looking for a single one is a distraction from all this discourse.
