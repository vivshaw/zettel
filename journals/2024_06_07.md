	- > The power of Lisp is its own worst enemy.
	  Here's a thought experiment to prove it: Take two programming languages, neither of which are object-oriented. Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to make them object-oriented, keeping them backward-compatible with the original languages, modulo some edge cases. Inserting any pair of programming languages into this thought experiment will show that this is easier with some languages than with others. That's the point of the thought experiment. Here's a trivial example: Intercal and Pascal.
	  Now make this thought experiment interesting: Imagine adding object orientation to the C and Scheme programming languages. Making Scheme object-oriented is a sophomore homework assignment. On the other hand, adding object orientation to C requires the programming chops of Bjarne Stroustrup.
	  The consequences of this divergence in needed talent and effort cause The Lisp Curse:
	  *Lisp is so powerful that problems which are technical issues in other programming languages are social issues in Lisp.*
