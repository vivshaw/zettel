	- > [...] a generally intelligent entity is one that achieves a special synthesis of three things:
	   — A way of interacting with and observing a complex environment. Typically this means embodiment: the ability to perceive and interact with the natural world.
	   — A robust world model covering the environment. This is the mechanism which allows an entity to perform quick inference with a reasonable accuracy. World models in humans are generally referred to as “intuition”, “fast thinking” or “system 1 thinking”.
	   — A mechanism for performing deep introspection on arbitrary topics. This is thought of in many different ways – it is “reasoning”, “slow thinking” or “system 2 thinking”.
