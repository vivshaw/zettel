	- based off the paper [Four concepts for resilience and the implications for the future of resilience engineering](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276139783_Four_concepts_for_resilience_and_the_implications_for_the_future_of_resilience_engineering)
	- suggests there are four things we might mean be resilience: [[rebounding]], [[robustness]], [[graceful extensibility]], and [[sustained adaptability]]. Woods thinks the latter two are what really make a system resilient!
	- this also introduced me to [[Safety-I and Safety-II]]! #safety
	- this is very cool. I should read more about resilience engineering.
- [The city and the limiting virtues](https://sarahendren.substack.com/p/the-city-and-the-limiting-virtues) - on architectural spaces, their virtues, and the value of limits. no-devices cafes, silent libraries, sacred spaces- what we _can't_ do in a space helps shape and enable what we _can_ #architecture #ethics #design #virtue
	- references David McPherson's "The Virtue of Limits" in the concept of "limiting virtues": humility, reverence, moderation, contentment, neighborliness, loyalty...
	- > McPherson calls us to a life with “enhanced autonomy”— a life with choices that are also informed by our loyalty to the given, unchosen world — what we might just call living with obligations. **I’d like to see designers take a renewed look at limits in their partnership for civic goods: rules that constrain and liberate.**
	- I think [[modesty]] is another interesting limiting virtue, if you squint at it right.
