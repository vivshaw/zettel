	- the principles:
		- logseq.order-list-type:: number
		  > **Principle #1: Hierarchical Collaboration Parity**
		  To be sustainably successful, the level of collaboration and alignment among managers or leaders in an organization must be equal to or greater than the level of collaboration required among their respective front-line team members to complete a task successfully.
		- logseq.order-list-type:: number
		  > **Principle #2: Alignment and Work Style Gaps**
		  Building on Principle #1, three critical gaps constrain team effectiveness.
		  * The divergence between leaders' perceived level of alignment and their actual degree of alignment
		  * The mismatch between the level of alignment among leaders and the alignment level required by the real-world demands of the task at hand
		  * The mismatch between the level of collaboration required to do the task at hand and the practical constraints of the environment (e.g., the ability to work together closely)
		- logseq.order-list-type:: number
		  > **Principle #3: Elephants and Front-Line Pragmatism**
		  Organizations are optimized to avoid confronting deep-seated tensions or 'elephants in the room' at the leadership level. This avoidance manifests in front-line teams having to navigate these unaddressed challenges in their daily work pragmatically.
