- managed to brick my Thinkpad and corrupt my boot disk yesterday. got all my stuff back though! lessons learned: #Windows #[[data recovery]]
	- if you use Windows Bitlocker, make sure you thoroughly back up your Bitlocker keys! otherwise, you're out of luck.
	- make an image of the disk ASAP, messing with it as little as possible
		- [ddrescue](https://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/) can do this, [HDDSuperClone](https://www.hddsuperclone.com/hddsuperclone) can do this with a fancy GUI and nice defaults
		- [HDDLiveCD](https://www.hddsuperclone.com/hddlivecd) is a decent bootable Linux distro with these tools
	- once you have that, you're not done yet. you have an image of the whole disk, and [a standard Windows boot disk has a few partitions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/configure-uefigpt-based-hard-drive-partitions?view=windows-11). you need to get ahold of the right one.
		- you can use something like [losetup](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/losetup.8.html) to scan the partition table and expose the partitions as [[loop device]]s. [StackOverflow with tips](https://superuser.com/a/1263401)
		- if you do this with a Windows tool, you may have Problems accessing files inside your `User` directories due to Windows file ACL
	- once you have the Bitlocker partition exposed as a device, you can use [dislocker](https://github.com/Aorimn/dislocker) to get in
	- if all that is too much work- [R-Studio T80+](https://www.r-studio.com/pro-data-recovery-and-forensic-for-small-business.html) can do all this in one suite right on your Windows machine
