	- > A particular AAA developer I know of once sent surveys to 1000 players asking them which game they had played the most, then compared it with the data of what they had actually played. Not a single one answered correctly.
	  Zero out of one thousand players could remember their own habits enough to tell which game they’d played the most. Player answers were so consistently wildly wrong that the team involved thought that their data must have been corrupted. Upon validating that it was in fact accurate, they went back to the players and told them what their actual most played games were, and every single one said something along the lines of “OH! Right. Well, that makes sense”.
	  When people tell you things they’re really telling you the stories they tell themselves about themselves, and those stories may not have anything at all to do with reality.
