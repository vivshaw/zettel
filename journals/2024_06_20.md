	- > A common misperception economic policies in African states tend to be statist, far-Left, or anti-market. This is not supported by the data (see examples of Kenya, Nigeria, Cote d’Ivoire, and South Africa below). In actual fact, most governments in the region tend to be eager adopters of allegedly apolitical “best practices” that are essentially center-right economic orthodoxy. If you add to this their social policies, the modal African government is essentially Center-right. What these countries often fail on is implementation (partially because said policies are seldom useful in context and/or due to weak state capacity).

	- > I think we have come to use “Senior Software Engineer” as shorthand for engineers who can ship code and be a net positive in terms of productivity, and I think that’s a huge mistake. It implies that less senior engineers must be a net negative in terms of productivity, which is untrue. And it elides the real nature of the work of software engineering, of which writing code is only a small part.
	- > By not hiring and training up junior engineers, we are cannibalizing our own future. We need to *stop doing that*.
