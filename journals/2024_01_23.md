- via In The Pipeline, [Screening Against AlphaFold Models: Maybe Better Than It Looks](https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/screening-against-alphafold-models-maybe-better-it-looks), a rundown of perhaps the first rigorous assessment of the results of DeepMind's AlphaFold project #chemistry #ml
	- > What's more, the team obtained a cryo-EM structure of one of the 5-HT2A hits bound to the protein, and the position and conformation of the small molecule lined up very well with the prediction. What's more: remember those three side chains that were misrotated in the model? Well, in the experimenal ligand-bound structure, one of these three actually moved into the alternate rotamer position that had been seen in the model but is not present in the unliganded receptor structure. This fits with the idea that AlphaFold models are sampling a number of closely related low-energy conformations, which are themselves likely to be experimentally accessible.
