		  And as with international trade, a lot of the benefits of AI will come from “new goods,”  Since the prices of those new goods previously were infinity (do note the degree of substability matters), those gains can be much higher than what we get from incremental productivity improvements.  The very popular Character.ai is already one such new good, not to mention I and many others enjoy playing around with LLMs just about every day.
