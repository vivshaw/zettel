	- >  I think that the real reason we are seeing a fundamental restructuring of the existing episteme, and its institutions from the university to institutions of scientific research, is that knowledge is increasingly incompatible with capital. It is telling us that our society, one which focuses on the wealth of the few at the expense of everyone, is unsustainable, unbearable. That the planet, our social existence, and even our individual health cannot be sustained under capitalism. This is America. When knowledge gets in the way of profits, destroy knowledge.
