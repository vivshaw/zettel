	- > When developers are allowed to use AI tools, they take 19% longer to  complete issuesâ€”a significant slowdown that goes against developer beliefs and expert forecasts. This gap between perception and reality is striking: developers expected AI to speed them up by 24%, and even after experiencing the slowdown, they still believed AI had sped them up by 20%.
