- Lorin Hochstein on how [Dijkstra never took a biology course](https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2025/05/31/dijkstra-never-took-a-biology-course/). is it _really_ true that "simplicity is a prerequisite for reliability"? or do reliable systems typically get that way by _adding_ complexity? maybe biology could inform engineering! #[[systems thinking]] #reliability #simplicity #complexity #[[complex systems]] #Dijkstra #biology
