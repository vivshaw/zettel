- [Where We Can Go](https://daneden.me/blog/2019/where-we-can-go)- Dan Eden on what's next for design systems #design #[[software engineering]] #frontend #[[design system]]
	- > We can’t prevent people from breaking the system, especially with the many handoffs that happen between different functions and teams. In turn, our role as a systems team turns from that of organizer and enforcer, to that of anthropologist and researcher. [...]
	  It’s futile for us to expect everyone to use the design system, so instead, we ask: why aren’t people using it? How can we make it more useful? How can we make a system that allows meaningful exploration and divergence from the system? And how can we make those divergences retain the spirit of the system?
	  And rather than trying to keep things in a specific order, constantly fighting
	  against the tide, we have to step back and see what form the system takes in the
	  hands of the people we build it for.
