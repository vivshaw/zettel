	- > While those groupings of “core” and “growth” skills are obvious groupings to me, what I came to appreciate while writing this is that some skills swap between core to growth as the fads evolve. Where execution is a foundational skill today, it was less of a core skill in the hypergrowth era, and even less in the investor era.
