	- spicy take on coupling:
		- > Our love affair with loose coupling is based on the desire to limit change propagation. If a seemingly simple change also necessitates a change in a far-away and ostensibly unrelated component, that’ll slow down development and lead to all sorts of unwelcome behavior like not fixing or refactoring things when needed.
		  The underlying constraint, which favors loose coupling, is that a) it’s difficult to find the places to change and b) that it’s difficult to make the change. In recent years, we have drastically reduced those constraints, for example through better source code management, global searches, CI/CD, automated tests, and much more. So, we can get away with much more tight coupling than we might be used to (and in fact, this observation led to [Gregor’s Law of Coupling](https://architectelevator.com/gregors-law/)).
