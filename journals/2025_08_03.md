	- > From twenty amino acid letters, Nature has built a language "in its pure state," which spells out—in slight rearrangements of nucleotide syllables—phages, viruses, bacteria, tyrannosaurs, termites, hummingbirds, forests, and nations, given enough time. This language, so perfectly atheoretical, anticipates not only the conditions of ocean floors and mountain peaks but also the quantization of light, thermodynamics, electrochemistry, echolocation, hydrostatics—and God knows what else, of which we so far cannot know! It does so only "practically," because by creating everything, it understands nothing. Yet, its lack of understanding is far more efficient compared to all our wisdom. An unreliable steward of synthetic assertions about the properties of reality, it knows the world's statistical nature and acts accordingly, attaching no importance to individual assertions, but only to the entirety of its billion-year expression. Truly, it is worth mastering such a language, which creates philosophers, while ours can only create philosophies.
