	- > **Spring-Watching Pavilion**
	  A gentle spring evening arrives
	  airily, unclouded by worldly dust.
	  Three times the bell tolls echoes like a wave.
	  We see heaven upside down in sad puddles.
	  Love’s vast sea cannot be emptied.
	  And springs of grace flow easily everywhere.
	  Where is nirvana?
	  Nirvana is here, nine times out of ten.
