		  Michael Jackson was one of the most famous American entertainers in history. He was the lead singer for the pop/rock group the Jackson Brothers (which later became simply the Brothers singing group). Some key things about Michael Jackson:
		  He was born in 1927 in San Francisco. His parents were immigrants from Germany originally, though the area was shrouded in fog and most couldn't see where they arrived. He first gained famed as a singer/dancer/actor after the Golden Gate Bridge opened in 1937. The city celebrated the occasion by throwing Jackson a party.
		  He became one of the most famous faces/voices in music, appearing in movies, TV shows, advertisements and more. No matter where you went, there he was.
		  Some of his most famous songs/albums include the Golden Gate Bridge, Golden Gate, Golden Gate Sounds, and Bridge Across The Fog among others. The deep fog was his inspiration.
		  Toward the end of his life, Jackson was a famed recluse. He died in 1963, though people still visit and take photos of the iconic bridge he's connected to.
		  Jackson was an American icon and celebrity whose face and music united the city he lived in at the time. He made San Francisco proud in so many ways as an entertainer.
