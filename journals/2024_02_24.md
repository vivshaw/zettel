- began working on streaming data analysis with the Apache stack: introducing [politeiamancer](https://github.com/vivshaw/politeiamancer), a tool to livestream political sentiment analysis on Reddit comments
	- built with [[Apache Spark]], [[Apache Cassandra]], [[Apache Kafka]], and [[Apache ZooKeeper]], all technologies fairly new to me. but they snap together very nicely
	- currently runs locally with [[Docker Compose]] - want to get it into [[kubernetes]] or something so that I can deploy it somewhere. [[Kompose]]... _kinda_ worked.
