- [Why Safety Profiles Failed](https://www.circle-lang.org/draft-profiles.html) - a good deep dive into the current status of C++'s memory safety proposal, and why it might not achieve its promises #C++ #safety
- from there, found Google's [Eliminating Memory Safety Vulnerabilities at the Source](https://security.googleblog.com/2024/09/eliminating-memory-safety-vulnerabilities-Android.html), with some interesting conclusions. Google moved only new code development to memory-safe languages. despite the amount of code in unsafe languages remaining, and in fact growing, memory vulnerabilities plummeted.
	- > * **The problem is overwhelmingly with new code**, necessitating a fundamental change in how we develop code.
	   * **Code matures and gets safer with time, exponentially**, making the returns on investments like rewrites diminish over time as code gets older.
	  For example, based on the average vulnerability lifetimes, 5-year-old code has a 3.4x (using lifetimes from the study) to 7.4x (using lifetimes observed in Android and Chromium) lower vulnerability density than new code.
