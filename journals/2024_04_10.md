- good stuff from TBM on ways of working:
	- [2-6-4-1](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-280-2-6-4-1), on an experimental alternative to regular ol' scrum that you might try when you feel like you can't get things done in a quarter and can't follow through on your plans #agile #pm
	- [Stop Chasing Unicorns](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-281-stop-chasing-unicorns), on how our focus on top-1%-in-product companies stops us from learning how to work better in our own orgs #pm
		- > [S]ome leaders ignore ways of working as a potential differentiator. They are too quick to assume that ways of working spring from hiring (or not hiring) "the best", instead of a set of capabilities you can support, grow, and strengthen. Ways of working often get derided as being too process-focused. On the flip side, other leaders have only vague notions of "being Agile," "being product-led," or "adopting a product operating model." It is 0/1, be, or not, and nothing in between.
