- TBM on [(un)common sense patterns in successful engineering management](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-330-uncommon-sense-playbook) #[[engineering management]] #product
	- > When I hear leaders say things like, "If we just had stronger managers!" I often wonder whether they realize they could hire mere mortal managers if those managers could run a common-sense playbook.
	  Do you want to optimize for managers who are skilled in navigating chaos?
	  The environment vs. individual debate often becomes a religious/philosophical argument. But even if we constrain ourselves entirely to the individual competency frame, difficult environments demand specialized, usually extreme, skills. While we might like to believe that 'A players' have all the necessary abilities to thrive in any context, it's worth considering what “normal” competent and motivated people can accomplish in a healthier, less extreme environment.
	  Sometimes, the real question isn't whether we need stronger managers but whether we're creating conditions where common sense can actually succeed.
