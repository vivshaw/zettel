	- > During his papacy, Pope Leo XIII was deeply concerned with the collateral social damage wrought by unchecked technological innovation. Now, seeing similarities between the technological shifts of centuries past, Leo XIV is ready to pick up where his immediate predecessor, Pope Francis, left off, holding the potential social costs of AI advancement front and center.

	- > The new model’s behaviour is based on a new kind of representation: the synchronization between neurons over time. We believe this is much more reminiscent of biological brains, while not a strict emulation. We call the resulting AI model the Continuous Thought Machine (CTM), a model capable of using this new time dimension, rich neuron dynamics and synchronization information to ‘think’ about a task and plan before giving its answers. We use the term ‘Continuous’ in the name because the CTM operates entirely in an internal ‘thinking dimension’ when reasoning. It is asynchronous regarding the data it consumes: it can reason about static data (e.g., images) or sequential data in an identical fashion. We tested this new model on a wide range of tasks and found that it is able to solve diverse problems and often in a very interpretable manner.
