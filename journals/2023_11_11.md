	- does modesty tie into the question of the [[narrative self]]? is a modest person less likely to take a narrative view of the self?
		- > Whether or not the modest person knows how good she is, she doesn’t experience the world in a self-involved way. Her own goodness just isn’t often on her mind. Understanding modesty in this way makes it less old-fashioned and, to me at least, something that actually seems worth having.
	- is modesty a rejection of comparative judgment?
		- > The kind of comparative concern associated with immodesty is deeply self-centred – everyone else’s status is compared with yours. A modest person, on the other hand, doesn’t care about that stuff, and so her experience is not coloured by self-centred concerns. It’s not that being modest means you don’t care at all about your own health, wellbeing or talents. But it does mean that you don’t care very much about comparative judgments of superiority, about one-upping other people.
