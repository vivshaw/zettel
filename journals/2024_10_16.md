- an interesting deep dive on [how Webpack splits CSS chunks](https://github.com/orgs/web-infra-dev/discussions/12), why we cannot rely on their load order to be consistent, and how upcoming CSS features may impact this #frontend #CSS #Webpack #[[platform engineering]]
- interesting presentation recently from TC39: [Language Evolution: Problems, and what we can do about it](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ylROTu3N6MyHzNzWJXQAc7Bo1O0FHO3lNKfQMfPOA4o/edit#slide=id.p) #JS #frontend #[[platform engineering]]
	- this proposes that we should split JS into a platformy, basic version implemented by browsers ("JS0"), and a sugary, dev-friendly version implemented by the dev tooling ("JSSugar"). this would remove the tension between devs' push for new features and implementers' need for stability and security, by promoting transpilation and the tooling layer into the core of the language.
