	- > The problem of misinformation in the current age, argues political scientist Samuel Bagg, is not that reliably truth-producing institutions and practices don’t exist, but that people have ceased to trust them. Changing that requires something deeper than factchecking or media literacy. It’s a matter of social identity, and solving it will mean reconfiguring the social identity landscape.
	- > This explains why all of our reasonably successful epistemic practices are collective in nature, relying not primarily on individual-level rationality, but on social structures calibrated to correct for individual limitations.
	- > That’s the nature of these things — they very often disappoint us. Truth in general very often is awkward and unpleasant and doesn’t fit with our identity, our social identity. If we’re trying to persuade people to trust in these institutions, these institutions, by their nature, insofar as they are genuinely truth-finding, seem to me inherently corrosive to social identity. They’re not going to tell you what you want to hear, and that’s what you need to reinforce a social identity over and over again — a holy book that never changes.
	  Science is going to constantly disappoint you and surprise you. Same with journalism. The truth is constantly going to be slightly at odds with what you wanted. It’s almost like we’re trying to build a social identity out of institutions that are themselves, over time, corrosive to social identities.
