- learned about [Eau de Space](https://eaudespace.com/), the perfume that smells like space. reviews: #space #fragrance
	- > A rather pleasant metallic sensation like sweet-smelling welding fumes, burning metal, a distinct odour of ozone, an acrid smell, walnuts and brake pads.
	- > The smell of *burning sweet rotted citrus flesh combined with scorched solder and plastic* is the only way I can describe this scent.
