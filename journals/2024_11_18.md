	- > In the olden days, a fairly standard model was “you go to a bank for a loan, and the bank gives you the loan, and if you don’t pay it back then the bank loses money.”
	  In modern banking, it is becoming more common for the model to be “you go to a bank for a loan, and the bank goes to an investor to get the money, and the bank lends you the money, and if you don’t pay it back then the investor loses the money.” The bank, in this model, is increasingly a sales network; it is in the business of having a lot of bankers who cover a lot of companies and can originate loans, but its balance sheet is precious, and it will try to find someone else to actually put up the money.

	- SRTs smell _suspiciously_ similar to CDOs & MBSs, don't they? I sure hope we don't find ourselves revisiting the Great Recession and referring back to these articles in a few years...
