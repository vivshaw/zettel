- discovered [[Mark Richards]]' [Software Architecture Monday](https://www.developertoarchitect.com/lessons/) - perhaps that shall be my New Years' project?
	- that, or my AWS certs
- New Years projects, methinks:
	- work: take better notes! make them useful, like these notes are! grow them organically, like these notes did!
	- eng: build expertise in software architecture
		- catch up with Software Architecture Monday
		- earn AWS SAA and SAP certs
		- read: [[DDIA]], [[The SRE Book]], [[Fundamentals of Software Architecture]], [[Software Architecture: The Hard Parts]]
		- holistically link up AWS/cloud knowledge with SRE/distsys knowledge
	- personal: read philosophy every month
