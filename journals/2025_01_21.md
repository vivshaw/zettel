The fact is that they operate at different scopes. The "just let it crash and restart" for Erlang often works at a request-level and sometimes at an even finer granularity. You can still benefit from the cluster-level control plane, but you get something much richer if you can have both. The problem is that unless you've tried both, you don't really have a good conception of what is possible, and it's easy to be locked to think inside the box.

There's a definite useful aspect to being able to do that, but losing the ability to work on things at a finer granularity is a huge loss.
