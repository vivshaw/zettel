- odd banger from last month- ["DJ E" by Chuquimamani-Condori](https://chuquimamani-condori.bandcamp.com/album/dj-e). (aka Elysia Crampton, aka E+E) sounds like... the vaporwave of Andean music. or... trying to construct an ambient soundscape when your only instruments are cumbia radio stations and bass-boost plugins. #ambient #[[deconstructed club]] #latin #vaporwave #music
