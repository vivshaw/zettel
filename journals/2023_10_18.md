- trying out [[logseq]] for the first time.
	- Obsidian didn't quite work out for me- the heirarchical, folder-based structure was a poor fit, and I'd prefer to fluidly tag and link whatever.
	- haven't tried an outliner before, but seems worth a shot. Really, I've not yet found a [[PKM]] strategy that _does_ work for me, so trying some new things is good!
	- interface is fairly laggy for me- should look into perf optimizations, perhaps.
- learning about [[Helm]] for the first time
- dumping some [[math]] and [[economics]] topics from my old Notion
- heard about [Ruvy](https://shopify.engineering/introducing-ruvy)- pretty neat Ruby WASM tool #ruby #wasm
