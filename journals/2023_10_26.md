- nuggets on starting platform teams, from a work convo: #[[platform engineering]] #[[engineering management]]
	- first, think about *governance of the platform*.
		- in fact, you should do this before taking on any real projects, or staffing out the team! start building out the team and breaking out projects **only once it becomes clear what a stream of defined platform work is**.
		- the amount of platform/DevEx/SRE work available to do will _always_ be bigger than your bandwidth- so you _need_ to have a clear vision of a) what specific platform work will drive impact and b) how you'll make decisions about it *before* you start planning & staffing for it.
	- welcome outside contributions, but keep control of the broad design aspect- system architecture, processes, etc. this lets you scale beyond your current team size without losing direction.
		- "we are the only teams that are incentivized to prioritize _global_ outcomes over _local_ outcomes." so, folks from product teams probably don't have the same incentives we do- and making _global, architectural_ changes while optimizing only for _local_ outcomes is a recipe for a bad time
