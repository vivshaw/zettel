	- > A defining feature of biology is the use of a multiscale architecture, ranging from molecular networks to cells, tissues, organs, whole bodies, and swarms. Crucially however, biology is not only nested structurally, but also functionally: each level is able to solve problems in distinct problem spaces, such as physiological, morphological, and behavioral state space. Percolating adaptive functionality from one level of competent subunits to a higher functional level of organization requires collective dynamics: multiple components must work together to achieve specific outcomes. [...] We explore the hypothesis that collective intelligence is not only the province of groups of animals, and that an important symmetry exists between the behavioral science of swarms and the competencies of cells and other biological systems at different scales.
- Alex Tabarrok on [the Prisoner's Dilemma of non-competes](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/04/the-prisoners-dilemma-of-non-competes.html), and the potentially surprisng positive and negative consequences of banning them: #economics
	- > More generally, non-competes are just one item in the wage bargain like hours, health and pension benefits. As a result, the FTC is quite wrong to think that banning non-competes will raise wages–the most immediate effect will be to reduce wages. Indeed, more workers will be willing to work at lower wages precisely to the extent that non-competes were a burden. Can’t have it both ways.
	- > More generally, worker mobility often carries externalities. As I [wrote earlier](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/02/is-science-a-public-good.html), ideas are in heads and if you don’t move the heads, often the ideas don’t move either. The [innovation that results from mobility](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2014/06/non-compete-clauses.html) is a public good.
