- surprisingly great releases from 2026: Anna Pest's [Dark Arms Reach Skyward With Bone White Fingers II: Be (Not) Afraid](https://annapest.bandcamp.com/album/dark-arms-reach-skyward-with-bone-white-fingers-ii-be-not-afraid). cover looks like 2000s Hot Topic core, album is apparently a Neon Genesis Evangelion-themed autobiography... and what's inside is some sort of BTBAM-esque prog deathcore epic that rips from front to back. "THINKING MAN'S RECESSIVE GENE MUSIC" indeed. #music #deathcore #prog #[[death metal]] #Canada
