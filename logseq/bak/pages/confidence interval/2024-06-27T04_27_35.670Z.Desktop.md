- a **confidence interval** for a given [[estimate]] is a range within which we'd expect to see the real population parameter, given a certain confidence level
	- the [[type-1 error]] for the interval, is in fact the same as the confidence level!
- for the mean, can be calculated like so:
	- if the population standard deviation is known, or the sample size is >= 30, `mu_ci = X_bar +/- z * (sigma / sqrt(n))`, where `z` is the [[Z-score]] of the given confidence interval
		- in [[R]], can use `lolcat`'s `z.test.onesample.simple()`
	- if the population standard deviation is *unknown* or the sample is small, we use mu_ci = X_bar +/- t * (sigma / sqrt(n)), where `t` is the [[t-score]] of the given confidence interval
		- in [[R]], can use `lolcat`'s `t.test.onesample.simple()`
- for variance, the [[Central Limit Theorem]] doesn't hold, so we need to use a [[chi-squared distribution]]
	- in [[R]], can use `lolcat`'s `variance.test.onesample.simple()`
- for a proportion, we'll use the [[binomial distribution]]
	- in [[R]], can use `lolcat`'s `proportion.test.onesample.exact.simple()`
- for a Poisson rate, we use a [[Poisson distribution]]
	- in [[R]], can use `poisson.test.onesample.simple()`
