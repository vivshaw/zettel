- # Starting from Scratch #[[design tokens]]
	- **Start with a feature, not a layout**
		- don't think about the shell of the app first. top bars, side navs, etc...
		- instead, think about the actual piece of functionality you wish to deliver. like "search for a flight". then, add the necessary pieces of UI to support that.
	- **Detail comes later**
		- start as lo-fi as possible. this forces you not to get hung up on the details.
		- don't even include color to begin with. design in greyscale, so that spacing, contrast, and size do the heavy lifting
		- don't over-invest! a mockup is not a product. a user can't accomplish their needs with it.
	- **Don't design too much**
		- you don't need to resolve every design question, feature, and edge case all at once. you will get paralyzed if you do.
		- **work iteratively.** get a _simple, basic_ design for the most _simple, basic_ question. once you're happy with it, then **actually build it.** then iterate from there.
		- the problems with designs will become much more clear once they're used in practice.
		- **be a pessimist.** don't put functionality in your designs that you aren't willing to build. remove every "nice-to-have". design and build the smallest viable solution.
			- this crosses over interestingly with non-product-design questions. like API design or org design. our interfaces should only imply the existence of what is really there! if we don't, we set ourselves up for failure.
	- **Choose a personality**
		- personality isn't as abstract and handwavy as it seems. a few concrete factors matter.
		- **[[typography]]** - serifs might feel more elegant, rounded sans might feel more playful, neutral sans might feel plainer.
		- color - choosing a key color might involve some color psychology and guesswork about associations
		- border radius - sharp borders tend to feel more formal, rounder borders tend to feel more playful
		- language - the personal or impersonal tone and formality or casual lingo you choose will impact the feel.
		- probably, you'll already have a gut feel of what you're aiming for, so this will be a matter of finding what aligns with that gut feel. **if you don't**, try looking at the sites of people you want to reach and borrowing their approach.
	- **Limit your choices**
		- the more design constraints you have, the fewer decisions you have to make. you life will become easier if you use constraints to eliminate irrelevant decisions.
		- **define systems in advance** - it's way harder to pull this stuff out of an existing organically-growing product, than to settle on the system and use it as a foundation. choose the values once, not every time you iterate.
		- use the process of elimination! take a few guesses and rule out the ones that look off.
		- **systematize everything you can.** fonts, colors, spacing, shadows, layouts... also, any time you find yourself making a laborious decision.
		- you don't need to have this all set in stone up front! just make sure you're following this approach each time you make a decision.
- # Hierarchy is Everything #hierarchy #[[information architecture]]
	- **Not all elements are equal.**
		- if all elements share similar visual importance, they will compete for your focus, and it will be hard to tell what matters
		- deliberately de-emphasizing secondary and tertiary info helps highlight the primary info!
	- **Size isn't everything**
		- font size is a useful tool, but you can't rely on it too much without making things illegibly small or comedically huge
		- try using font color or font weight!
		- try to stick to ~2-3 colors (primary, secondary, tertiary), and two font weights (normal and bold). that should be enough for most needs.
	- **Don't use grey text on colored backgrounds!**
		- this will mess up your contrast
		- what you actually want is a color closer to the BG color. but simply using transparency won't work, especially if there are patterns
		- instead, pick a custom color that's closer to the background
	- **Emphasize by de-emphasizing**
		- instead of piling on more and more to emphasize an unclear element, try de-emphasizing everything around it.
	- **Labels are a last resort**
		- don't go "Name: Foo Bar, Phone Number: 555-555-5555", etc. folks already know what names and numbers are! you can probably skip the labels entirely in many cases.
		- in cases where the label is actually _meaningful_, try to combine it with the value. for example, instead of `In Stock: 12`, try `12 left in stock`. (and emphasize the `12`)
		- in cases where a separate label is needed, make it secondary, so that it does not distract from the content
		- there are some cases you might skip these rules. for example, if you're nuilding a page that should have skimmable structure data, like product dimensions
	- **Separate visual hierarchy from document hierarchy**
		- don't tie visual hierarchy to semantic tags!
		- we are often trained to think of `h1` as meaning `big`- but in reality, some `h1` uses might be more like a label than a visually primary piece of content!
		- you might even include some sections for #a11y, that are _totally hidden_ visually
	- **Balance weight and contrast**
		- color and weight actually play a similar role in how dark UI elements are psychologically perceived to be
		- icons, especially solid ones, therefore might feel pretty emphasized! you can counteract that by choosing a lighter color
		- conversely, sometimes is you need to emphasize something with a light color, widening it may help
	- **Semantics are secondary**
		- when designing a page with buttons, don't just map button semantic -> color and call it a day! you need a hierarchy of actions.
		- in most flows, there's probably just 1 primary action, a couple of secondary ones, and a couple of less-frequently used tertiary ones.
		- reserve bright colors for primary actions. secondary actions can be more muted. tertiary actions can probably be styled like links!
		- you don't need a big red button for every destructive action. even if destructive, actions should be treated according to the hierarchy.
			- what you might _actually_ want instead, is a separate confirmation step where the destructive action _is_ primary!
