- a probability [[distribution]] representing all the possible sample statistics of a given size, that could have been obtained from a given [[population (statistics)]].
- the RSD of the sample mean:
	- its [[mean]] is the mean of all the means, X-double-bar or mu_sub_X_bar. this will equal the population mean.
	- its' [[SD]] is the population SD divided by `sqrt(n)`. this is also known as the [[standard error of the mean]], or sigma_sub_x_bar. this will be smaller than the SD of the population..
