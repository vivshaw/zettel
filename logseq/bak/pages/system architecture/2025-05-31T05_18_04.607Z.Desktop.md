- we can look at a system in terms of the bits that it's made of, and there are multiple ways we might carve it up: [[functions (SE)]] , logical components, physical parts, etc. an architecture captures a view of what bits the system is made of and how they are related to one another.
- we can think of functional -> logical -> physical architecture as an ordered chain from "What?" to "Who?" to "Where?"
