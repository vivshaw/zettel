- the single source of truth for all the management aspects of the syseng process. it'll contain:
	- a description of the project. we want to clarify the system's goals and scope.
	- structure for work, communication, and decision making. what roles and responsibilities are there? including a description of team structure, and any resources required by each team
	- any important objectives during the project's lifetime
	- a communications plan, and communication standards for the involved teams
	- a [[risk management (SE)]] plan
	- an integration and testing plan
- in practice, a lot of this document might be boilerplate that's shared between most of your company's projects.
