- the Payback Period is the time necessary for an investment to be fully recovered
- two ways to calculate:
	- **simple payback period:** ignores [[TVM]], and simply looks for when cumulative cashflows are 0.
		- this is more common in business due to simplicity
	- **discounted payback period:** discounts each cashflow, and looks for when cumulative discounted cashflows are 0.
	- discounted PBP will always be longer than simple PBP
