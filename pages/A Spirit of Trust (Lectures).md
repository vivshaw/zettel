	- [[Kant]]'s discovery of the normativity of intentionality- the axiom around which Kant's thought revolves
		- what distinguishes knowers from nonconscious natural objects is not some mysterious "mind-stuff". it's that judgments and intentional doings are commitments- exercises of a type of authority. they're all normative.
		- we are creatures who live, move, and have our being in a normative space, articulated by our judgments, responsibilities, and exercises of our authority
		- at the core of what we're responsible for is *having reasons for our commitments*
