- Lecture 1 - [Why Read Hegel Now?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=va1sDoPRTAU)
	- First big Kantian idea: [[Kant]]'s discovery of the normativity of [[intentionality]] - the axiom around which Kant's thought revolves
		- what distinguishes knowers from nonconscious natural objects is not some mysterious "mind-stuff". it's that judgments and intentional doings are commitments- exercises of a type of authority. they're all normative.
		- we are creatures who live, move, and have our being in a normative space, articulated by our judgments, responsibilities, and exercises of our authority
		- at the core of what we're responsible for is *having reasons for our commitments*
		- these are _rational_ commitments- in the sense that it always makes sense to ask us "why"?
		- we find this downstream in [[Wittgenstein]] and [[Sellars]]
	- Hegel is the one we really have the most to learn from here, not Kant!
	- for Kant, "the judgment is the minimal unit of responsibility"
		- what sort of responsibility? the responsibility to integrate it into a constellation of commitments that's distinctive of apperception- the [[transcendental unity of apperception]]
			- in some way, this sounds reminiscent of [[coherentism]]
	- for Kant, **[[representation]] is normative**.
		- one becomes responsible _to_ the object one judges, _for_ the judgment
		- understand the represented is having an authority over the representing- it sets the standard
		- Hegel reconceives this in terms of **social practices**. the normative relation is _not_ between the representing and the represented anymore. in Kant, this account is implicit and unexploited. Hegel takes it and runs with it
	- Kant's account of freedom and normativity
		- starts from [[Rousseau]]'s account: "freedom is obedience to a law one has laid down for oneself"
		- this is turned into a normative constraint. what distinguishes these things from causal constraints is that only we can bind ourselves in this way
	- and so, the **Basic Kantian Normative Status (BKNS)**:
		- the authority to make oneself responsible (commit oneself)
		- by taking oneself to be responsible (acknowledging a responsibility)
		- this is what makes one a person, gives them the dignity of the subject
	- second big Kantian idea: the [[categories (philosophy)]] of the understanding
		- there are concepts that don't just serve to explain and describe _empirical happenings_, but that serve to explain and describe _the practices and abilities through which we encounter empirical happenings_
		- he sees these as [[a priori]]- we don't need to have any particular empirical experience to use them, and we use them whenever we describe or explain anything
		- these stands in contrast to [[Hume]]'s view in [[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]], where he felt he could understand the explanatory use of a concept yet be clueless about its descriptive role. Kant sees that explanation and description are reciprocal.
	- jumping ahead to the Neo-Kantians, who also understood this "normative revolution" in Kant, and which [[Locke]] does not contain
		- [[Kuno Fischer]] was the first "back to Kant" guy- he was also [[Frege]]'s teacher
			- reconstrued Kant as a philosopher of science
		- then, Marburg Kantians
			- [[Hermann Cohen]] and [[Paul Natorp]], focused on the sciences
		- and Freiburg Kantians
			- [[Windelband]]
			- and [[Heinrich Rickert]], who taught [[Heidegger]] and [[Bruno Bauch]] (who in turn taught [[Carnap]])
		- the final generation, [[Ernst Cassirer]]
		- but from there on, arguably to [[C.I. Lewis]] and [[Carnap]], and from there onwards to [[Sellars]]
	- the Neo-Kantians recognized Kant's normative insight, but didn't recognize that Hegel also saw it
		- "Kant depsychologized epistemology, then [[Frege]] depsychologized logic, then [[Wittgenstein]] depsychologized psychology"
		- they oscillated between naturalistic reductionism about normativity, and dualism about it
	- so... how do we address Kant's insight, without turning the *distinction* into a *dualism* (norms vs. facts, ought vs. is, histories vs. natures)?
	- we go on to Hegel!
	- **Hegel's first insight: "the social move"** normativity is _social_. the essence isn't the autonomous self-binding of Kant, but **reciprocal recognition**
		- to be a normative subject is to be recognized as such (in turn, by those you recognize as such!)
		- all transcendental constitution is social institution
			- we need to understand norms in terms of the structure of the social practices of a community.
			- what makes a signpoint more than just a piece of wood? its embeddedness in a system of social practices
			- this is effectively what the late [[Wittgenstein]] is on about!
		- **self-consciousness doesn't happen between one's ears.** it's a relation between members of a community
			- shades of [[extended mind]]/[[EEEC]]! ðŸ‘€
		- normative statuses are attitude-dependent- what you are committed to depends on what you take yourself to be dependent to.
		- there are canonical pathologies of recognition when it is asymmetric
		- [[Kojeve]]'s seminars were when this Hegelian idea really came to the fore
	- Hegel vs [[Wittgenstein]] - they are both committed to the same project of sociality, with a common approach... except Hegel is a systematic metaphysician, and Wittgenstein is very much not!
	- **Hegel's second insight: "the historical move"** normative creatures don't have natures- they have histories!
		- as essentially self-conscious beings, what we are _for_ ourselves (our attitudes) are an essential part of what we are _in_ ourselves (our statuses)
		- we can *change* what we are *in* ourselves via changing what we are *for* ourselves, in a reciprocal way:
			- when we change what we are *for* ourselves (practical self-consciousness), we change what we are *in* ourselves.
			- in turn, we recognize that change (theoretical self-consciousness), changing what we are *for* ourselves, our attitudes
			- which again changes what we are _in_ ourselves, our statuses
			- and these are never identical! we do not have Cartesian transparency- there is opacity, difference, distance
		- and so, we do not have natures, we have histories. to understand what we are, we must understand how we got to be that way
		- the rehearsal of the process that brought you where you are, *Erinnerung* (recollection), is important for Hegel. it's what turns a past into a history. it's what turns what merely happened into something done.
		- this recollective rationality is the form of Reason's march through history
	- **normativity itself has history!**
		- for Hegel, *Geist* (spirit) means "all of our norm-governed doings and institutions, the normative space in which we live, move, and have our being"
		- *Geist* has a structure, and that structure changes! and the biggest change of all, for Hegel, is the advent of modernity
			- while many other philosophers *developed* modernity, Hegel was the first to "see it whole"- to view it as one united change, and to study it as such
			- what is part of modernity? the rise of science, Enlightenment thought, political liberalism, economic capitalism, the rise of the novel... changes in religious, social, political, and artistic institutions...
			- the change is a change in the structure of *Geist*. it's a change from the [[scala naturae]], the Great Chain of Being, a hierarchical-obedience relation, into a modern, subjective self-consciousness
			- this is the birth of [[sociology]] as much as it is a sea change in philosophy
			- this is also really the root of the analytic-continental split! *should* we take modernity to be a philosophical problem? or not? for the analytics, maybe the rise of science, but not modernity
		- Hegel "sees the worm in our apple"- the alienation we feel from our social norms, which is part of modernity. for Hegel, once we understand that, we'll understand what the next phase of Geist must be.
	- how should we hermeneutically interpret texts? #hermeneutics
		- easy to fall into a [[Lockean]]/[[Gricean]] picture of meaning, where it's a gem in the mind of the writer, and a successful act of communication is one that reproduces that gem in the mind of the reader
		- consider [[Borges]]'s *Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote* - a book about a man who rewrites the Quixote word-for-word, and is acclaimed for its rich literary allusions to the present times of the early 20th century
		- Brandom follows an **inferential approach to meaning**, which rejects semantic atomism, and focuses on the conceptual and inferential roles things play in reasoning
		- [[death of the author]] and [[Foucault]]'s writing on French police reports as "a work", [[Quine]]/[[Duhem]] on [[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]
		- a Hegelian reading is one that recollectively rationally reconstructs Hegel, just as Hegel in turn read Kant. it is valid to appeal to things that happened after Hegel, and arguments that Hegel did not make but later folks did.
		- *de dicto* (what did the author really say?), *de traditione* (what is the author's tradition, earlier and later, committed to?), *de re* (what is the author _really_ committed to, whether or not they meant to say it?) readings
	- recommended reading:
		- Inwood translation, or Miller
		- Not Pinkard's translation
		- [[Hippolyte]] - close to the text *de dicto* reading
		- [[Kojeve]]
		- Pinkard's commementary and biography
		- Carlyle's [[Sartor Resartus]], a first-rate parody of Hegel
