- an extremely useful package of stats utilities for R.
	- [documentation on RDRR](https://rdrr.io/github/burrm/lolcat/)
- most of lolcat's tests have a few versions:
	- a default version, which you can pass a dataframe into
	- a `.simple` version, which you can use when you have the summary stats already
	- potentially a `.fx` version, which you can pass an R function into
