- the divide-and-conquer strategy is one that recursively breaks a problem down into smaller subproblems, until those subproblems are simple enough to solve.
- three phases:
	- **divide** the problem into one or more subproblems
	- **conquer** the subproblems recursively
	- **combine** them into a solution of the problem
