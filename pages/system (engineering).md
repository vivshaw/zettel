- per [[INCOSE]]:
	- > A system is a construct or collection of different elements that together produce results not obtainable by the elements alone.
- per the DOD:
	- > A system is an aggregation of system elements and enabling system elements to achieve a given purpose or provide a needed capability.
- common characteristics of systems:
	- a system is something made of integrated parts, with interfaces, boundaries, and relationships as key parts of the system
	- a system is likely a team effort, probably even multi-team!
	- a system generally has some defined purpose or capabilities
	- a system can help us conceptualize and deal with complexity
- we could think of something as simple as a stapler as a system. it has various parts that need to work together. but it's not very *interesting*- staplers are rather simple! we'd find the system perspective much more illuminating with a more complex system, like a research facility, or a battleship, or an ecosystem.
