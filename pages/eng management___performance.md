- how to set up a mid-cycle checkin:
	- have everyone write a brag doc. cover these 4 areas:
		- **scope** - what were you a DRI for? what projects did you contrib to? think, "what am I accountable for?"
		- **impact** - what outcomes did you achieve. back them up with quant metrics when you can. should not be about effort
		- **work/knowledge** - what work have you done? when have you been tapped for your knowledge? (e.g., being an SME). this can be purely effort. doesn't need to tie into outcomes. can include #OSS contribs
		- **org** - how did you interface with others? did you lead trainings? help with onboarding? build alignment on a dificult plan? take ownership of a meeting or process?
	- once written, share with mgr. goal is to understand:
		- what's going great?
		- where are growth opportunities? is there any support that would help?
		- in general, are things on or off track?
	- hopefully, this can serve as the raw material for the actual perf review
