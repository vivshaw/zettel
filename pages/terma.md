- *terma*, in the Tibetan tradition, are Buddhist teachings that result from revelation, rather than scriptures passed down through the ages
- Tibetan Buddhists place an emphasis on *lineage*. in order to receive an authentic and effective *terma* teaching, it's considered important to receive it in an unbroken line of transmission from the original master. otherwise, you might receive a diluted or distorted teaching!
