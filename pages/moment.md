- a **moment** is a generalization of the average of deviations from the mean raised to some power.
- can be **raw** (uses raw values), **central** (uses deviations from a central point), or **standardized** (divided by the [[standard deviation]] to the power of the moment)
- interesting moments:
	- **1st, raw** - the [[mean]]
	- **2nd, central** - [[variance]]
	- **3rd, standardized** - [[skewness]]
	- **4th, standardized** - [[kurtosis]]
