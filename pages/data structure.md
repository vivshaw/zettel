- a **data structure** is a method of storing and organizing data for efficient use.
- some examples:
	- [[array]]s
	- [[heap]]s
	- [[hash table]]
	- [[graphs]]
	- [[tree (DS)]]s
- typically, these structures will include data items. these might be primitive types like `int` or `str`, or they might themselves be composite data structures
- it is common to use keys for identification, such as an array's index, or a hash table's hash
