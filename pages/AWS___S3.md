- global storage platform, regional resilience
	- you selecct region when you upload stuff
- public service
- default storage service for AWS- economical, fast, great for holding tons of static data, great input/output for AWS services
- it is [[object storage]], not [[file storage]] or [[block storage]]
	- so, only kinda like a filesystem, but kinda like a [[KV store]]
	- you can't mount S3 as a drive!
- core concepts:
	- **objects:** sorta like a file. a blob of data and metadata, with a key (filename)
		- can range from 0B to 5TB
		- no concept of filetype- file extension is just part of th ekey
	- **buckets:** sorta like a folder. it's what you store objects in.
		- exists in a region, and never leaves it (unless configured)
		- **needs a globally unique name!**
			- can be 3-63 characters
			- must start with a lowercase letter or number
			- can't be IP formatted
		- unlimited # of objects, unlimited size
		- no complex structure! all objects are stored at the same level
			- if you use names with `/`s, it will _look_ like a folder. but it ain't. this is often called a 'prefix'
		- 100 bucket soft limit, 1000 bucket hard limit
