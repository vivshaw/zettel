- a statistical test in which we draw only a single sample. e.g.:
	- has the failure rate of this engine part changed from its historical rate?
- for [[mean]]s:
	- if the [[SD]] is known and the sample size is at least 30, you can use the [[z-test]]. otherwise, use the [[t-test]].
- for [[variance]], use the [[chi-square test]]
- for [[proportion]]s, use the [[binomial test]]
- for ordinal data, use the [[Wilcoxon signed ranks test]]
- for [[Poisson distribution]] rate, use the [[Poisson test]]
