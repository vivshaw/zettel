- **discrete cost modeling**- choose the minimum cost among several discrete options
	- e.g., maybe you're evaluating a choice between two different electric motors to use in your factory.
- **continuous cost modeling**- finding minimum cost when cost is a continuous function of one or more variables
	- e.g., maybe you're determining the optimal speed to travel at relative to fuel efficiency at that speed
