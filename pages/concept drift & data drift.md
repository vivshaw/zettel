alias:: data drift, concept drift

- when your data and reality drift apart over time
- e.g., what if you're building speech recognition, but language evolves over a few years? or, new cellphone have different mics that pick up the words differently?
- can happen suddenly or slowly- e.g., COVID was a sudden concept drift for fraud detection systems
- difference between data and concept drift:
	- when your input data X changes over time, that's data drift
	- when your desired mapping x->y changes, that's concept drift
