- a critic of classic, poetic depictions of the gods, as in [[Homer]] or [[Hesiod]]
	- "If cattle could depict the gods, they would look like cattle!"
	- this is not an atheist view, though- X believed these portrayals of gods as petty, warring, adultering human-like beings was shameful
	- instead, the gods should be portrayed as totally unlike us! understanding them is beyond our grasp
	- similar to the [[Milesian school]], explained natural phenomena not as gods, but as nature
