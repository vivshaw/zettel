	- types of power:
		- **role power** - what your org grants you to compel others to act for the org
		- **relationship power** - your own ability to persuade others because of their knowledge and trust of you
		- **expertise power** - others' perception of your technical, industrial, or topical knowledge
	- the [Allen Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_curve) - frequency of communication drops exponentially as distance increases
- **1: What Is An Effective Manager?**
  collapsed:: true
	- **your first responsibility as a manager is to achieve results.**
		- > Phrase borrowed from the military: "Mission first, people always"
		- the only way to feel good about this is to have quantified, measurable goals
	- **your second responsibility is to retain your people.**
		- retention is "the brake against an unrelenting results focus". chasing results pressures your reports. if you pressure 'em so hard they leave, you've lost goodwill, institutional memory, money, time... so don't do that!
	- that's it. that's [[the role of a manager]]!
	- the rest of the book is based on empirical studies of tools managers use to fulfil that role effectively.
- **2: The Four Critical Behaviors**
  collapsed:: true
	- **get to know your people**
		- people and their actions are what create results! not systems, machines, processes, metrics...
		- we need to be able to manage people who are different from us, and that means being willing to adjust
		- think you know your people well? ok- what are the first names of all their kids? if you don't know that, how well do you know 'em?
		- being familiar with your reports is not the same as being friends with them. you *don't* want to be friends with your reports.
		- your reports probably don't see you as a nice person- they see you *as their boss*. because you are! because of your role power, your reports see you differently than you see yourself
		- you are not part of the team, any more than a sports coach is part of their team.
		- what's important is **building trust**. and to do that, you're going to need to talk about what's important with your reports! frequently!
		- **getting to know your directs accounts for 40% of the value of the four behaviors.**
	- **communicate about performance**
		- you can't do better if you don't have feedback that tells you what needs addressed.
		- just like you wish you had feedback, your reports wish they had it from you.
		- **performance communication accounts for 30% of the value.**
	- **ask for more**
		- counterintuitively, as managers, we're *supposed* to create stress for our directs. but not distress- [[eustress]]. the type of stress that get folks pumped, pushes them to try new things and achieve what they thought they couldn't.
		- a manager is responsible not just for maintaining the status quo, but improving the team's performance. and you can only do that by improving individual performance.
		- it's better to grow capability by growing the people you have, than throwing headcount at your problems. it's cheaper, more durable, builds on existing relationships, builds a succession plan, and reduces hiring risk. what's not to like?
		- **asking for more accounts for 15% of the value.**
	- **push work down**
		- pushing work down creates capacity for the organization
		- anything that either your or a direct could do at an acceptable level of quality... have your direct do it! it's a matter of [[comparative advantage]]. you are a manager and can be doing more efficient things with your (expensive!) time.
		- you might be worried that they're too busy. guess  what? everybody's busy, all the time! what matters is making sure that *the most important work is getting done*. and the way to do that is to share it.
		- **pushing work down accounts for 15% of the value.**
- **3: Teachable and Sustainable Tools**
  collapsed:: true
	- > However you manage, your techniques/behavior/philosophy *must be both teachable to others and sustainable*.
	- it's not enough to d oyour job well. you need to be able to communicate about our work with others. this is obvious for other jobs. but somehow, we don't hold managers to this standard, and treat it like a mystery that folks "just know how to do". that's wrong!
	- > What does it say about the most important systemic behavior in any organization- management- that the majority of us learned how to do it from somebody *who was never taught it and privately worried that others would discover that they didn't truly know what they were doing*?
	- personality has nothin' to do with it- you can be an effective manager regardless of introversion/extroversion, energy level, etc.
	- to grow an organization, you need to create new managers. and the best way to do that is to teach them before they step into the shoes. learning while in the role is the hard way, with full consequences and heavy burdens, at exactly the time the organization *doesn't* need weak, new managers, but strong ones that can carry out the growth
	- what tools worked empirically?
		- **Get to know your people:** [[one-on-ones]]
		- **Communicate about performance:** feedback
		- **Ask for more:** coaching
		- **Push work down:** delegation
- **4: Get to Know your People - One-on-Ones** #one-on-ones
  collapsed:: true
	- getting to know your reports is the single most important behavior, and 1:1s are the single best tool to do it.
	- a one-on-one is: **a scheduled, weekly, 30-minute meeting with each of your directs, where your direct goes first, and you take notes.**
	- properties in order of importance:
		- **scheduled**
			- put 'em on a regular schedule, at the same time every week.
			- if you think your calendar doesn't have space for this, you're wrong. compare your business today to your business a few months out. your calendar doesn't fill up until the 1-2 weeks ahead! so just start scheduling 1:1s a month or tw oout, and it'll Just Work™️
			- if you don't schedule them, you're only 20% likely to *do* them!
			- why is this important?
				- **my boss is saying I'm important** - setting aside regular, scheduled time, implies your reports matter at least that much
				- **I have time to prepare** - if you know it's coming, you can prep!
			- it's OK to move them when there are conflicts! having them scheduled is still just as beneficial, even if the schedule has to be changed.
		- **weekly**
			- we do our work in weekly increments, so we should meet in weekly increments! that aligns best with the rhythm of work
			- if you have them every other week, you're instead implying: "this 1:1 is worth less to me than what I'm working on right now". you lose 60% of the value this way. so... do weekly!
			- weekly cadence also wins you a reduction in interruptions. folks know they get a chance each and every week to address stuff with you.
			- fine to start with biweekly if you have more than ~10 directs
			- if you team is bigger than 20-25 directs... it's too big! these suggestions won't help much!
		- **30 minutes**
			- no benefit in going longer, and in fact causes a reduction in successful O3s
			- better to have a 30-minute jam-packed meeting, than an hour meeting that's half-empty
			- caveat: if you're a senior exec, you may need a full hour.
		- **with each of your directs**
			- gotta do 'em with everybody. and if you do 'em with everybdy, you should do 'em the _same_ with everybody, or else you create a sense of segregation
				- so, if you need to spend additional time with particular directs- sure, do that, but not in the form of the O3!
			- not about _differentiating_ directs, but about *making time for each* direct
			- don't do 'em with anyone other than your directs! this includes skip-levels. you maintian comms with skip-levels through your directs talking to their directs
		- **where your direct goes first**
			- O3s are business meetings, so they have a purpose, an agenda
				- try this: 10 mins for your direct, 10 for you, then 10 mins for the future
				- probably, their 10 mins will run over, and probably, you'll rarely talk about the future... that's OK! don't practice "agenda fascism". let it be organic.
			- O3s will start with you making a statement or asking a question. you can just start with the same one every time. nothin' wrong with predictability
			- don't ask for their list of topics in advance, don't send a list of topics in advance, and don't use O3s for stuff that needs to go out to the whole team
			- are you worried that your 1:1s are too much like status updates? don't be! that's normal for many folks.
			- if you run out of content, just end early
				- if a direct is consistently uncommunicative, give them time
		- **and you take notes**
			- if you don't take notes, you're less engaged, less interested, less likely to take action, less accountable...
			- having a standard form is good.
			- don't scatter your O3 notes in your usual "go to meetings" notebook- put them somewhere dedicated
			- have a distinctive way to capture deliverables
			- also capture comms or responsibilities in a separate distinctive way
			- the key to this document isn't form, formality, length... it's whether it is contemporaneous
			- capture coaching notes "on the back of last week's form"- nearby, so you see 'em during next week's session
	- recommends against taking notes on laptop- you won't remember as much
	- don't do O3s in public! but you don't have to get fancy about where to do it either.. if directs want greater privacy, they'll ask
	- you can do O3s over the phone when needed- it'll get 80% of the value.
		- Zoom is better- 90% of the value, in that case
	- common pushback to O3s:
		- "it's micromanaging"
			- consider the Middleman Test: *"Never tolerate from your directs that which you would not visit upon your boss. And never do to your boss that which you would not accept from your directs."*
			- realistically, it just isn't micromanaging. and in fact, if anything there is on average too *little* management.
			- someone objecting to this is either afraid of oversight or thinks they're above it- both are bad!
			- explain what micromanagement really is, and why this ain't it
			- if needed, just use your role power
		- "I'm too busy"
			- as with scheduling above- everybody has time if you schedule far enough out. people are thinking about how busy they are now.
			- you're asking for only ~1% of their time!
			- again, if needed use role power
- **5: Doing One on Ones with Remote and Hybrid Workers** #one-on-ones
  collapsed:: true
	- we communicate less with those who are distant from us
	- so, O3s become *even more necessary*!
	- try to persuade folks to come into the office or be colocated with you
	- managers working from home is the exception and not the rule
		- executive roles require exceptional relationship-building. role power is not what makes it work.
		- "When you look at the top of your organization, what you call politics, they call collaboration."
		- **The political capital necessary to achieve executive success is nearly impossible to build from a distance.**

- **6: How to Start Doing Manager Tools One on Ones** #one-on-ones
  collapsed:: true
	- Choose times from your calendar
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- rule of thumb for how many options to make available so each direct gets a calender slot that works for them: how many directs do you have? provide 1.5x that many options #nuggets
		- *don't* throw your calendar open and say, "any time is fine"! your directs are committing tohalf an hour per week. you're committing to as many O3s per week as you have directs. so, you need to be more sensitive to your own schedule!
		- avoid: times right before and after staff meetings, Friday afternoons, Monday mornings
		- no preference for all on one day vs. spread out
	- Send out an O3 email invitation
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- send out a broadcast email, not individual invites!
	- Allow for possible changes and questions as you get started
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- things will change, stuff will get rescheduled, etc. and that's OK! just pick something that works for the near future
	- Brief your team on your O3s
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- take questions! and it's OK to say, "I don't know! we'll figure it out as we go."
	- Do O3s ONLY for 12 weeks
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- don't make too many changes at once! make 'em one at a time. do O3s *first*, and on their own. you can think about other changes later.
		- don't rush toward seeking or giving feedback! just plain O3s on their own should help. so master that first.
- **7: Talk About Performance - Feedback** #feedback #performance
  collapsed:: true
	- this is the second most important manager behavior
	- MT presents a feedback model to "give positive or negative feedback easily, and routinely, taking no more than 15 seconds each time. And your directs won't complain."
	- > When the typical manager gives feedback, *the focus is on what happened*. We think about what happened in the past, and we ask ourselves how to talk to the direct.
	  About what happened. In the past. *Which we can do nothing about.*
	  (p. 105)
	- of _course_ your directs get defensive when you talk to them about their mistakes! they're things that happened in the past, about which they can now do nothing to change.
		- if they try to justify their actions, that makes sense too! consider your own life:
			- did I make any mistakes in the last month?
			- did I *intend* to make them?
		- your directs' answers are gonna be pretty similar to yours!
	- other things that lead to defensiveness:
		- lack of trust
		- infrequent performance feedback. if it doesn't happen frequently, when it does happen, it'll be seen as "you're in trouble now!"
		- role power- their livelihood depends on your approval, of course they'd feel defensive about that
	- many managers use a "threat" model of feedback- negative only, scheduled meetings to talk over "an issue of some concern", threats of writeups. this doesn't work.
	- but _most_ managers do something else: **they give no feedback at all**!
		- this can't work. humans *need* feedback in our social interactions
		- in human psychology, an environment without feedback is called a [[wicked environment]]!
	- a better model: **the purpose of performance communications (and therefore feedback) is to encourage effective future behavior**
		- this is future-oriented- it's about _stuff we can change_
		- this also lets us focus not on the negatives of what went wrong, but on the positives of what you _want_.
	- how to do that in practice? USE **the Manager Tools Feedback Model:**
		- **ask**
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- *"Can I have a word?" / "Can I give you some feedback?"*
			- ask, every time, whether it's positive or negative feedback
			- the purpose is to make sure we have their attention. there's no point in talking about their future behavior if now is a bad time!
			- honor a "no" if it is given. sincerity matters!
			- empirically, asking directs for permission increased their appreciation for the feedback and likelihood of following through
		- **describe the behavior**
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- focus on behavior is critical! but we often fail to do that, for two reasons
				- we might think we're good at know what others were thinking or feeling
				- we might want to "fix the root of the problem" rather than "the symptom"
			- unfortunately... we are incredibly wrong about that! we are fallible humans who have no idea what others are thinking or feeling. empirically, we're wrong 60-70% of the time. that means we'll be "fixing" the wrong cause!
			- directs also just plain don't like it! it's unpleasant when someone assumes what you're thinking and tells you it's wrong
			- so, don't talk about "attitude", what they "meant to do", "why" they did it, whether they "know better"- none of that is helpful.
			- so, **what is behavior?** in the business world, these 5 things:
				- the words you say. not just whether you speak up, but how you phrase it
				- how you say those words. your tone, tenor, speed, inflection- the vocal parts of our [[non-verbal communication]]
				- your facial expressions and eye contact. another piece of [[non-verbal communication]] that has a wider impact than you might think.
				- your body language. yet more [[non-verbal communication]]- how you sit or stand, what you do with your hands and arms, where you face
				- work product. "What you do and how well you do your job are behaviors as well."
					- > Conceptually, this in part flows from your organization as an entity unto itself, *with you and your fellow associates as the hands and arms and eyes and ears of the firm.*
					- think about
						- quality- how does it compares to established standards? was it effective? was it excellent?
						- quantity- how much have you done? did it meet your numerical goals, if any?
						- accuracy- does it require rework?
						- timeliness- did you meet the deadline? are you on time to work and to meetings?
						- documentation- did you communicate your work? emails and documentation and Slack chat are all behaviors!
			- *start with a "When you..." statement*
				- this is the key! center the feedback on the specific instance of behavior!
				- don't "soften the blow"- it doesn't help
				- keep it snappy!
		- **describe the impact of the behavior**
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- say what happened because of what the direct did. this model works on cause and effect- the direct's behavior was a cause, and something positive or negative happened as an effect.
			- this is the second clause of the "When you" statement
			- this doesn't have to be big and important! it can be small behaviors and small impacts.
				- it's more important to be frequent than to wait for big occasions. if you did, you'd barely ever give feedback
				- feedback on many small changes will add up!
		- **encourage effective future behavior**
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- here, we either encourage a change in behavior (by asking for it!), or encourage continuing a behavior (by thanking the direct!)
				- for positive feedback, a simple "thanks", "well done", "I appreciate you" can be all it takes.
				- for negative feedback, start simple. just ask them to handle it differently next time
					- once you get some practice in and build some trust, you can advance to asking "what can you do differently?" and seeing what they come up with
	- it is OK if the model feels like a script at first. practice is what brings it to life and makes it natural. the script is just to get you off the ground and practicing!
	- following this model helps keep feedback quick and frequent, and build a habit
	- **don't** try to engage in a dialog about feedback! this is popular, but the data suggests it's ineffective. consider- nobody suggests we have a discussion about *positive* feedback. that's a good sign this is off-track.
		- empirical data shows that this approach is correlated with _worse_ performance, not better!
		- this also makes feedback way faster
		- ...which in turn encourages doing it more frequently! the longer it takes to give feedback, the less we give
		- **discussions about intent are useless!** who ever _intends_ to mess up?
			- these also get interpreted by the manager as "defensiveness", but what else would you expect the direct to talk about? this is also a great cue that the manager isn't separating behavior from emotions, intents, beliefs, etc.
			- you might not be doing that. you might be thinking, "how can I find the root cause of the behavior?" but this is not the manager's job- it's the manager's job to give the feedback, it's the direct's job to follow through on it and solve their problems. if they want help, they will ask you for it!
		- **discussions about the past are useless!** the past already happened. the purpose of feedback is to encourage better behaviors in the future.
		- **asking for reasons aims us at the wrong target!** often, it will _strengthen_ commitment to the old behavior, since it probably had good reasons!
		- **root cause analysis and feedback are two separate tasks, with different goals.**
			- doing RCA takes up more time, so the more of it you do, the less time you have. feedback does not have this problem
			- doing RCA will incentivize reports to bring their problems to you to solve. but problems are most efficiently solved at the level they happen!
	- give feedback as soon as practical. no more than a week after the behavior.
		- this is not the same as immediate! the perfect is the enemy of the good. as soon as practical is good enough.
		- we live our work lives in weekly increments, so one week is good enough. plus, our recall of the past is imperfect, and one week is recent enough.
	- feedback doesn't necessarily need to be private! this private-convo-behind-a-locked-door thing makes it too big of a deal. most feedback is about small things
	- don't wait for a pattern to appear before giving feedback! by the time there's an engrained pattern, you've waited too long.
		- plus, wouldn't you feel bad if your boss deliberately let you make an avoidable mistake for a few weeks just to prove to you that there was a problem? wouldn't you prefer to hear the feedback soon?
	- pay attention to tone! positive and negative feedback should both be given with the same, positive tone. think:
		- **am I angry?** then don't give feedback!
		- **do I want to remind or punish?** then don't give feedback!
		- **can I let it go?** paradoxically, if you _can't_ let it go, then you _should_ let it go.
		- if you don't pass any of these checks, you either delay the feedback 'til you can give it well, or defer it completely and don't give it.
	- **what to do about pushback?**
		- think of the "shot across the bow" in a naval engagement
		- here's the trick- the feedback itself _was_ the shot across the bow! so, _don't do anything_! don't argue about it, don't punish, don't talk about the past. just keep giving feedback
		- if you need to, *straight-up give in*. what matters is whether the direct changes their behavior in the future. winning or losing an argument is useless toward that end.
	- what if feedback doesn't stick? that's what Systematic Feedback is for:
		- keep giving feedback, in the exact same way
		- if you're following the pattern, you'll have ended each feedback with a request- "can you work on that?" etc.
		- after many incidents of the direct saying "yes" but not following through, you now have not an issue with the behavior you gave feedback about, but an issue of *honesty*, which is much more serious. so you _give feedback about the honesty issue_.
	- what if your direct doesn't know what to do?
		- if it looks like they need help, *ask* if they do! but only do this when you have reason to think they do- 93% of the time they don't!
			- then, maybe you have a quick answer- give it!
			- or, maybe you don't have a quick answer, or don't have time right now- that's also OK. tell them you're glad they're willing to ask for help, but unfortunately you have to go do such-and-such right now, so can they grab a calendar slot and we'll work on it? keep it positive in tone!
	- **if you want to be able to give more negative feedback, give more _positive_ feedback.**
		- this helps build trust!
		- in a group of effective managers the author followed, the ratio was **9 to 1**!
		- this tracks- if work is going ok, most of what happens is good. and if you've done 9 good things, wouldn't it feel just awful to have them ignored and just the 1 bad thing mentioned? plus, _positive feedback is reinforcement_- so if folks are doing stuff you wanna see more of, _you gotta tell them that_!
- **8: Giving Feedback to Remote Directs**
  collapsed:: true
	- remote feedback works basically the same as in-person. it's still essential, and the same techniques should still do the trick
	- but there are some unique challenges
		- **feedback should be verbal.** written feedback isn't as effective, and is more time-consuming. additionally, positive and negative feedback should sound the same, and written comms don't sound like anything!
			- try giving feedback verbally, in 1:1s, after a Zoom, after a standup. or ask for a call.
		- **feedback should be behavior-driven.** but remotely, it's harder to know what the behavior was!
			- not impossible though! you can see what people say and how they say it on Slack, their tone and body language on Zooms, whether they're camera-off
	- one approach to making remote easier: **learn to assign deliverables, not tasks.** use a public work tracker like a Kanban. if the deliverable is a message or doc, ask for a CC.
- **9: How to Start Delivering Feedback**
  collapsed:: true
	- it is critical to build trust first!
	- don't start until you've had ~12 weeks of 1:1s
	- introduce the change before you make it. say you're gonna do it, then do it!
	- don't rush into negative feedback. go slow, start with the positive. you can even give only positive feedback for 8 weeks or so before branching into negative.
	- start by shooting for 1 item of feedback per day. if you find that's really easy after a few weeks, you can increase it slowly. again, no rush- keep it a sustainable pace!
	- if you have any doubts on your readiness to add in negative feedback, wait. clearly, what you doing now is working well enough that you still have your job. better to stick with the imperfect-but-OK thing for a few extra days or weeks, than rush into the new thing and mess it up!
	- most importantly, **keep the emphasis positive**. positive feedback is more powerful than negative. don't go overboard when you start mixing in the negative feedback and have it crowd out the positive.
- **10: Ask for More - Coaching** #coaching #performance #pedagogy
  collapsed:: true
	- **coaching is a way to supervise the self-driven improvement process of a direct over time**
		- it can be done in as little as 5-10 minutes/week
		- it isn't the same as feedback, it isn't the same as a heavy 6-month planning process
	- steps of the coaching process:
		- **step 1: collaborate to set a goal**
			- you will not be a teacher, preparing lesson plans and teaching 'em like a schoolchild.
			- **adults learn by doing**
			- do this by describing a behavior or result, starting with a deadline. for example, "by Feburary 1, you will obtain your AWS Solutions Architect Associate cert"
			- **DBQ goal model**- Deadline, Behavior, Quality
			- how far away should the deadline be? at least 4 months, otherwise it should just be feedback. if you're not sure, take your best guess and double it. better to set a longer goal and have your direct feel awesome for crushing it, then a shorter goal that they barely skate by and feel like a failure.
			- this has got to be behavior _they_ want to improve! this is self-directed, not top down.
			- you can make this easier by giving them a heads-up in a 1:1 in advance! that way, they'll know to come ready to talk about their goals
		- **step 2: collaborate to brainstorm resources**
			- you, the manager don't know everything. yet, if you can only coach on the things you know, there will be barely any things you can coach on. how do you get around this?
			- you need to a) collaborate with your direct, and b) plan on finding and using outside resources, *even though you don't know which is best yet*
			- so, having your direct do research as part of this process is normal, and sometimes picking a resource that turns out to be a flop is normal and not a waste!
			- how to brainstorm? we each take 2-3 minutes to guess some resources we _think_ might be _potentially_ helpful. go for volume, not accuracy. you don't know what the plan is! so your goal is to get all the options on the table. then, share our lists.
		- **step 3: collaborate to create a plan**
			- we've got a goal, we've got some ideas... that's enough to start a plan!
			- together, pick 1-2 resources to start with, and a series of deliverables for the direct. each deliverable has a deadline, a behavior, and reporting that it's done.
			- as in the first two steps, the direct takes the lead. they'll be doing the work, so they should pick work they want to do!
			- **only plan the first 1-2 weeks**. do **not** waterfall it. it would take too long, we don't know enough, and things will change. keep your coaching agile and very short in scope
			- close deadlines also encourage action! "due next month = do next month". so keeping terms short encourages actual follow-through.
			- remember from [[project management]]- every project is in danger of being delayed by the longest subtask!
			- reporting the task as done is important! even when it's done _in the mind of the doer_, it has no use to the organization until the world _knows_ it's done. and it's best for the direct to own communicating this. they're the first to know, and their efforts to communicate it are the lowest cost.
		- **step 4: the direct acts and reports on the plan**
			- we've now set some short term goals, and are getting regular updates. check in in the weekly 1:1! briefly chat about progress at the end of the 1:1. if they aren't making the goals, we can give some negative feedback, following our usual feedback patterns. if they do meet the goals, give positive feedback.
			- then we just continue iterating from here until the DBQ goal is reached! and when they do, celebrate with them!
		- if the direct runs out of tasks, brainstorm some new ones next 1:1
		- if a resource is unhelpful, drop it! don't [[sunk-cost]] your way to failure.
- **11: How to Coach Remote Directs** #coaching #performance #pedagogy
  collapsed:: true
	- it's not _that_ much more difficult to coach remote directs. the vast majority of the work is identical, and 95% of your portion will be done in the usual 1:1 you're already having.
	- consider these differences:
		- if 1:1s are already long, consider a separate coaching meeting
		- because you don't see your directs as often, you won't intuitively know their progress as much, so you may need to ask more explicitly
	- **make sure you're setting deliverables!** this was already important, but is even more important when remote. you don't want to remotely chase down the status of every task, nor do you want to wait for a week-long feedback loop!
	- consider a shared status board, like a Kanban thingy or spreadsheet. that'll both help you stay in sync, and let you reflect on progress once you're been working on it for a while

	- it's gonna be a lot like 1:1s and feedback. brief your team first. walk through the model.
	- if you're following this book's guidance, this isn't gonna start until 8 months after you start 1:1s (and 4 months after you start feedback).
	- don't start coaching everyone at once. start with top performers. it's a bit easier, and has lower stakes than coaching low performers where improvement is a must.

	- moving from IC to manager is about moving from being smart about *stuff*, to smart about *people*
	- when you make the jump to manager, your job isn't to throw yourself at problems, it's to _make other more effective at working on problems_
	- the single biggest kiss of death for executives is failure to delegate. so you need to start learning this early.
	- > **[W]hen you look up at the top of your organization, what you call politics, those executives call collaboration.**

	- delegation is key for organizational growth. by transferring work from a high-cost area (management) to a lower cost area (directs), you've freed up time and resources for other things. at the same time, you've given your direct a stretch to grow their own skills.
	- delegate one or more of your _small_ responsibilities to your directs. don't pick a bit one- what's big for you will be _crushing_ for them! small for you will be big for them.
	- delegate a _settled, routine_ responsibility. you don't know how new responsibilities should be properly done, so how could you delegate them?
	- won't this overload the IC who ends up with a new task, who was already full? yes, absolutely- *so they should drop some existing tasks to make room*. let them "delegate to the floor" what they need to in order to make room. taking on new responsibilities will end up deprioritizing others, and that's just life.
	- don't delegate your primary responsibilities. delegate the side work.
	- don't think about yourself. don't delegate the stuff you don't like, don't need, etc. your directs will realize you're just pushing work ont hem that you don't want, and they'll say "no" or not do it! this is the "push model" of delegation. don't do it.
	- delegate work that fits the direct: what they **want to do**, **like to do**, **need for growth**, and **are good at**. this is the "pull model" of delegation.
	- don't judge by whether "I could do it quicker/better". you can't do everything, and it's not your job to. your job is to enable others to do it! so, ask instead: "can my direct do it at the level I did when I first started?" you were good enough back then, so if they can do it at that level, they're also good enough.
	- not every thing that comes to "us" is coming to us personally. much of it is to "our role" or "our office". and it's our job to figure out what and delegate accordingly.
	- four no-brainers to consider delegating:
		- **reporting** - it's not an effective use of your time. _and_ it teaches the direct what execs look at for your team
		- **meetings** - managers should be doing three things in a meeting- running it, contributing to it, and evaluating their directs' performance in it. if you delegate running it, you can spend more time on the more valuable two.
		- **presentations** - these are important to get good it, but the way to learn a thing is to do the thing. so if your directs want or need to get good at presenting, you need to let 'em present!
		- **projects** - you don't need to be de-facto project manager of all projects! let you directs build some PM muscles
	- how to do it:
		- **state you'd like help.** just give a high-level, one-sentence version of the task.
		- **tell why you're asking them in particular.** center it around want/need/like/are good at, as above
		- **ask for acceptance.** don't tell. that would be using our role power. we want to be using our trust! so, we let our direct choose.
			- we do this _before_ explaining the fine details! that way, we don't waste time in asking, and if they're interested, they'll be focused on the details as you get into it
		- **describe the task in detail.**
		- **go over quality and deadline standards.**
		- **nail down reporting standards.**
		- **ask for skill/resource needs.** "What do you need from me?"
	- what if a direct keeps saying "no" to delegation? well... they _can_ say no, that's intentional. you need to be willing to honor that if you're building trust and not leaning on role power.
		- after two or more "no"s in a row, reexamine your assumptions. are they overloaded? what's the behavior and tone you observe like? how's attendance. saying "no" is fine, but a general deterioration in the relationship is _not_ fine.
		- after three, you should have a different conversation. refusing any particular delegation is A-OK, but a general refusal to handle new or different work isn't. organizations grow and change, and the employees need to adapt. talk about how to become a team player, and why they aren't yet.
- **14: Delegating to Remote Directs** #delegation
  collapsed:: true
	- as with coaching, this does not differ much from in-person
	- you need a high level of trust, which might take longer to build remote, so you might need to wait longer
	- you can use your 1:1 time for it. give them a heads-up in advance if so! so they don't get blindsided, and can come in with questions and expectations.
- **15: How to Start Delegating**
  collapsed:: true
	- 8 months, when you start coaching, is probably good.
	- you _can_ go sooner here, but probably still give 3 months or so for 1:1s to build trust.
	- slide it forward a little for top performers, especially those who are likely to get promoted to management.
	- as with the other tools, brief the team!
- **16: The Manager Tools Manager**
  collapsed:: true
	- implement these tools with love- the willingness to risk yourself for the benefit of another. these tools _need_ to be used in service of lifting your team up and helping them do their best work. they need to be used with respect, positivity, and care. even the tough parts, like negative feedback or hard conversations. be direct, be kind, and be a good person.
