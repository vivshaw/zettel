- a **schema** is a pattern of thinking and behavior that people use to interpret the world. it is a cognitive shortcut that lets us reduce the massive quantity of information of the external world into a mental model we can fit in our heads and reason about
- [[Jean Piaget]] introduced them in his theory of [[human development]]
- there are two ways of dealing with new information:
	- **assimilation:** cram it into an existing schema
	- **accommodation:** update your schemata to make room for the new information. you might alter an existing schema or form a new one entirely
	- as we age, we tend to lose cognitive flexibility and move more and more towards assimilation
- **four major types of schema:**
	- **person schemata:** focused on specific individuals
	- **social schemata:** focused on general knowledge about how people behave
	- **self schemata:** focused on knowledge about yourself
	- **event schemata:** focused on patterns of behavior. what to do and say, how you should act, etc.
