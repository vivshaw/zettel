- **measurement** is the process of assigning numbers to an event. it produces **data** as its output.
- a good measurement system should be:
	- stable through time, or, "in control"
	- [[reliable (statistics)]], in that it is repeatable and reproducible
	- [[valid]], in that it measures what it should, without bias.
- one might measure using several types of **measurement scale**:
	- **nominal**- where a number is assigned to categorize something arbitrarily. zip codes, area codes, employee IDs.
		- this is [[qualitative data]]
		- it can only indicate which properties are and aren't equal
		- you can analyze frequency or proportion, but not much else
	- **ordinal**- where numbers are assigned such that their order corresponds with the order of the measured property. [[Likert scale]]s, letter grades in school, sound in decibels
		- this is [[discrete data]]
		- ratings and rankings are ordinal. rankings are preferred over ratings when you have the option, but are harder to get!
		- uniform differences in the measurement may **not** correspond to uniform differences in the underlying property.
		- you can use the [[median]] and [[mode]] to find the "center", [[range]] or [[interquartile range]] for dispersion, and = / != / < / >. plus the above. but you can't determine magnitude.
	- **interval**- where numbers are assigned so that differences in any two measurements correspond to proportional differences in the underlying property. temperature in degrees, distance in miles, calendar date
		- this is [[continuous data]]
		- zero and negative values may be possible here!
		- can use [[mean]], [[SD]], even meaningfully take sums or differences. plus the above.
	- **ratio**- when you have an interval scale, where there's a meaningful zero value (corresponding to a null value, or lack of the property). length, height, width, weight, volume
		- this is [[continuous data]]
		- can use [[geometric mean]], [[coefficient of variation]]. plus the above.
	- **absolute** or **ratio discrete**- numbers directly are the underlying property. number of defects, number of parts, number of accidents
		- this is [[discrete data]]
		- you can use mean, median, and mode
