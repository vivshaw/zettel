- qualitative methods:
	- **executive opinions:** form a consensus across upper management.
		- works best in smaller companies, where upper management is in touch with sales
	- **delphi method:** gather a group of industry experts, get their individual opinions, then get them to meet as a group and discuss those opinions until you reach a conclusion
		- better for high-level forecasts than business details
		- you'll likely need to pay the experts
	- **customer surveys**
		- survey fatigue is a thing, also newer customers may not participate
- quantitative methods:
	- **simple growth rate models:** estimate based on the recent rate of change of sales. what was the % delta between last period and this period? that's the expected delta between this period and next
		- only effective if sales are uniform and non-seasonal
	- **moving average models:** average the last N periods. that's your estimate for next period. as next month's actuals come in, that's the next data point, and you update the next forecast accordingly.
		- this will show trends, but it's a lagging indicator
		- doesn't forecast much beyond the next period
	- **linear trend analysis:** do a linear regression
	- **nonlinear trend analysis:** fit something non-linear, like an exponential or polynomial
