- any project should start with an analysis of the other options out there, to make sure there really is a need for it! we should compare the **effectiveness**, the **suitability**, and the **lifecycle cost** of the solution

- you need to choose a good **measure of effectiveness** that will allow you to compare these alternatives fairly and accurately for your use case
- programs that neglect this step tend to have worse costs and more delays!
- in the US Government, the [[GAO]] provides reports about analyses of alternatives
