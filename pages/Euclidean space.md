- equivalent to the set $\R^n$ of tuples of $n$ real numbers, plus the [[dot product]]
- we can compute distance in a 2-d Euclidean space between two points $x$ and $y$ by using the [[Pythagorean Theorem]] to measure the hypotenuse of a triangle defined by them, like so:
	- $\rho = \sqrt{((x_g - x_r)^2 + (y_g - y_r^2))}$
	- but this is exactly equivalent to the [[L2 norm]]!
- we can compute orientation using $atan2(y_g - y_r, x_g - x_r)$
