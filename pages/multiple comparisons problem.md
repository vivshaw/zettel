- if I do one comparison at an $\alpha$ of $0.05$, I have a [[type-1 error]] of $5\%$. but if I perform 100 comparisons at that level on the same data, I have a  $1 - 0.95^{100} \approx 99.4\%$ chance of committing at least on type-1 error!
- this bites us if, for example, we judge a treatment on many outcomes- e.g., assess the efficacy of a drug by reduction in _any_ symptom
- it also happens if we choose which parameters to include based on the observed data. each time we assess the significance of a variable, we add more room for error!
