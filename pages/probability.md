- if you ask a [[frequentist]], the likelihood that an [[event (statistics)]] will happen. if you ask a [[Bayesian]], the degree of rational belief that it will.
- typically expressed as a number between 0 and 1
- types:
	- a **simple**, **marginal**, or **unconditional** probability is just the probability of a single event. e.g., the probability that you get heads when you flip a coin
- rules:
	- **addition rule**: $P(A\ or\ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\ and\ B)$
	- **joint rule**: $P(A\ and\ B) = P(A) * P(B|A)$
	- **conditional rule**: $P(B|A) = P(B\ and\ A) / P(A)$
