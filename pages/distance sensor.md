- a common way to do this is with a light emitter-receiver pair, relying on the nonlinear reduction in intensity we'll have as a light moves farther away
- we could also project a known visual pattern, then measure the amount of bending we see in that pattern to determine not just how far awway the structure is but what type of structure it is. the Kinect does something like this
- we can also measure distance with sound, using an ultrasound emitter-receiver pair
- or with a laser, relying on the phase shift in a sweeping laser beam. this is what [[LIDAR]] does.
