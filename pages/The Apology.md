- an account of Socrates' defense in his trial for corrupting the youth
- Socrates outlines his view that he is not a teacher, and knows nothing. his task is to interrogate those who *think* they know something. and it turns out, none of them do! the wisest are the most foolish, while the common folk are closest to wisdom
	- > Neither be called instructors, for you have one instructor, the Christ. The greatest among you shall be your servant. Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
	  *Matthew 23, 10-12*
	- shades also of [[ordinary language philosophy]]
- Socrates on corrupting and educating the youth:
	- **if only a few are good horse-trainers, and the majority are bad, isn't the same true of trainers of youth?**
	- **corrupting the youth harms them and causes them to harm others. but who would want to be around those who would harm them?**
	- **how could I believe in spirits but not gods, if spirits are gods and their children?**
	- **why fear death when we don't know it to be an evil?**
	- > someone who genuinely fights for what is just, if he wishes to survive even for a short time, must engage in private practice but not in public politics.
