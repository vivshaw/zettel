- a mental model where we split frontend eng into two conceptual buckets:
	- **front-of-the-frontend:** determines the look and feel of components and pages, does traditional "web development" stuff in HTML and CSS, lightweight JS- just enough to get the presentation right
	- **back-of-the-frontend:** determines the business logic that components and pages implement, and specializes in the JS and framework stuff necessary to make that happen
