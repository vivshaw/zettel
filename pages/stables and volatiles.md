- original article: [Stables and Volatiles](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/stables-and-volatiles/)
- stables and volatiles are types of engineers
	- **stables** rely on process and measurement, prefer predictability, and are reliable and calm
	- **volatiles** are risk takers, high-productivity with less quality emphasis, stifled by process, "leaving a trail of disruption in their wake"
- according to Lopp, an organization needs both! without volatiles, you can find your org on the slow train to nowhere, reliably plodding along toward achieving nothing. without stables, you can find your org with a pile of half-broken hacks and no credibility
	- > Your Stables are there to remind you about reality and to define process whereby large groups of people can be coordinated to actually get work done. Your Stables bring predictability, repeatability, credibility to your execution, and you need to build a world where they can thrive.
	  Your Volatiles are there to remind you that nothing lasts, and that the world is full of Volatiles who consider it their mission in life to replace the inefficient, boring, and uninspired. You can’t actually build them a world because they’ll think you’re up to something Stable, so you need to create a corner of the building where they can disrupt.
