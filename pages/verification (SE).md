- **verification** is a check for **correctness**. it answers the question, "did you build it right?"
	- it gathers evidence that the system performs all of the functions it should, and meets all the specified requirements from the requirements docs.
	- verification starts during development, and we're the ones who do it. we'll do it as many times as needed to ensure the whole system meets its requirements.
	- contrast with [[validation (SE)]]
- ideally, each of the [[requirements (SE)]] should have a specified method to verify it!
- in systems engineering, there are several **methods of verification**:
	- [[testing (SE)]]
	- [[analysis (SE)]]
	- [[inspection (SE)]]
	- [[demonstration (SE)]]
