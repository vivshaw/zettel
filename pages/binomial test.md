tags:: stats, [[statistical tests]]

- a test that uses the [[binomial distribution]], most commonly used for [[proportion]]s
- underlying assumptions:
	- the data is binomially distributed
	- the data is random
- you may not be able to get the exact [[type-1 error]] or [[type-2 error]] you want, since the data is discrete.
- in [[R]], can use [[lolcat]] 's `proportion.test.onesample.exact.simple()`
