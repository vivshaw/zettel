- one way you could frame it is around scope and level of ambiguity:
	- > IC1 (Junior) owns Tasks + Learning (mostly learning!)
	  IC2 (Junior II) owns Tasks
	  IC3 (Senior I) owns Projects
	  IC4 (Senior II) owns Objectives
	  IC5 (Staff) owns Strategy
	  IC6 (Principal) owns Vision
	- [[vision]] means, where are we trying to get to? if I had a magic wand to wave, what end state would I summon?
	  [[strategy]] means, how do I get from where I am now, to the end state I envisioned
	- objectives means, what are we gonna focus on? what should we measure?
	- projects means, "team: GO!". it's about execution as a team. turning projects into well-scoped tasks and doing them.
- or similarly, around ownership:
	- > IC1: given small (1-2 day) well-defined tasks and support from the team, owns executing on those tasks with assistance. will learn to do so independently in a reasonable span of time (1-2 years).
	  IC2: given small (1-2 day) well-defined tasks, owns independently executing on them. meets the quality standards of the team while doing so.
	  IC3: given measurable goals, owns defining single-team projects (1-6 weeks) to achieve those goals. Calls out assumptions and risks. Breaks down the project into tasks and/or milestones.
	  IC4: given a strategy, owns breaking that strategy down into measurable objectives (like [[OKR]]s) to achieve it.
	  IC5: given a vision, owns reaching broad alignment on a strategy to achieve that vision
	  IC6: given nothing, owns creating and aligning on a large-scope vision, to the point where the vision is supported and funded by the org.
- another frame is around goals:
	- > IC3 owns one KR from your [[OKR]]s 
	  IC4 owns one objective from your [[OKR]]s
	  IC5 helps you write your [[OKR]]s
	  IC6 helps multiple teams write and execute on their [[OKR]]s
- another frame is around strategy engagement:
	- > IC5 owns strategy
	  IC4 helps shape strategy
	  IC3 follows strategy
- another is about autonomy. how much rope should you give before intervening? how often should you feel you need to step in?
	- > IC6 should be fine operating independently almost indefinitely
	  IC5 for 2-3 months
	  IC4 for a month
	  IC3 for ~2 weeks
	  IC2 for a few days
- we can move as well to a multidimensional framework. for example:
	- > Scope: What area do they own?
	  Impact: What business impact did they accomplish?
	  Tech: What technical expertise do they bring to the table?
	  Org: How do they interface with other humans?
	  Growth: What should they focus on to grow beyond their current point? Are they doing it?
	- treat it like a radar chart! each level likely has different requirements of each dimension, which might not scale linearly. each engineer is likely "spiky", exceeding more in some areas than others. that's OK! we just want to ensure a rough match between the team's needs, the engineer's profile, and the role's requirements, not absolute uniformity. we'd rather have a variety of folks who greatly excel at particular areas than an overall average.
	- what does it mean when someone's seriously overperforming in one of those dimensions?
		- Scope: you should probably get promoted eventually
		- Impact: You should probably get a top performer grant
		- Tech: You should probably be given more scope
		- Org: You should consider the management track
