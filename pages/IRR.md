- Internal Rate of Return is the rate of return that makes the PV of cash inflows equal to the PV of the cash outflows
	- that's a way to say, it's the actual rate of return on the project
- a project is worthwhile when its IRR is greater than the company's [[discount rate]]
- the IRR can sometimes overstate the value of a project, relative to other metrics like the [[NPV]]! this is because the IRR implicitly assumes that all a project's financial benefits are reinvested at the IRR. which in fact they are not!
	- we can use the **MIRR**, which instead assumes all reinvestment to be at the [[discount rate]], for a more accurate picture.
