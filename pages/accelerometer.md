- measures translational [[acceleration]]. we can then integrate to find speed and distance
- a basic accelerometer is a mass hanging on a damped spring. but the type we use in electronics are typically tiny [[MEMS]] devices nowadays
- with accelerometers, we can get three of the six [[degrees of freedom]] in $\R^3$
- vertebrates have accelerometers in their ears- the [otolith](https://dizziness-and-balance.com/anatomy/ear/otoliths.html)!
