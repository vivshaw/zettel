- how to get a 30-60-90 right:
	- don't think about it going forward. envision the future where this team member has fully onboarded and rocks. now, *work backwards* and figure out what steps we need to get from here to there.
	- pick a small, but arbitrary number of goals. 3 is good- why not just say "here are the top 3 priorities?"
		- it's better to utterly crush a small set of priorities, than have distributed outcomes across all of them. #focus
		- don't just toss 3 projects at them. pick 3 *multidimensional* goals. maybe one goal is a technical project, another is social connection and mentorship, another is something else entirely.
		- can frame it like [[TDD]]- "here's the future state I wish I were in. here's the 3 most important statements that would be true then. they aren't true now, so here are the steps to get there"
