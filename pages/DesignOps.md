- from Michelle Chin:
	- > DesignOps is the specialized support services that help ensure that the design team can do its best. If you consider individual contributors on the design team (e.g., designers, researchers, content people, etc.) as professional athletes, DesignOps people are the athletic trainers, nutritionists, etc. They have special skills that allow individual contributors to focus on their craft and set them up for success.
- can be divided into:
	- **TeamOps:** holistically supporting workflow and culture that horizontally benefit the design org
	- **ProductOps:** work with designers on supporting a specific product
- one of the hardest parts is [[change management]]!
