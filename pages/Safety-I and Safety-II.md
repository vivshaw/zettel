- the traditional view of safety is that it is the opposite of "lack of safety", and can be defined as "absence of accidents". unsafety is an exceptional state. to understand safety, you need to understand the exceptional states in which accidents occur. there are specific technical or organizational causes of these deviations. we maximize safety by ensuring that as few things as possible go wrong. we'll call this view **Safety-I**.
- in resilience engineering, we instead think that "‘things go wrong’ and ‘things go right’ for the same basic reasons".
- this leads to a different view. Safety is "the ability to succeed under varying conditions". When accidents happen, it's because of variability in the everyday conditions, the same ones where things usualyl go right. we need to understand how things go right, in order to grasp how things go wrong. we maximize safety by ensuring that as many things as possible go right. we'll call this view **Safety-II**.
