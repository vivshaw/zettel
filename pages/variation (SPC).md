- every [[process (SPC)]] has **variability!** the output is always slightly different.
	- this can be due to many factors- the materials, the machinery, the measurement, human action, the environment...
	- statistically, this is expressed as [[variance]] in a [[distribution]].
- can be broken into two types:
	- **common cause variation** is inherent to all processes. it's the result of many different sources of variability. there's not a single explanation as to why this variation happens. these cause the output of any process to be a [[distribution]].
	- **special cause variation** happens when changes in the variables cause changes to the common cause distribution. there is a specific cause for the change.
		- special causes can be good or bad! we should implement countermeasures against bad special causes, but good ones should be incorporated into the process.
