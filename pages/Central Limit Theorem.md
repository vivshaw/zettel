- regardless of the population distribution, as the sample size increases...
	- the [[random sampling distribution of the mean]] approaches normal distribution
- regardless of the sample size _or_ population distribution...
	- the mean of the [[random sampling distribution of the mean]] equals the population [[mean]], and the standard deviation of the RSD equals the population [[SD]] divided by the square root of n
- so:
	- for large sample size (n >= 30), regardless of the original population distribution, the normal distribution is a good approximation to the sampling distribution of X_bar when sigma is known.
