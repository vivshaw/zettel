- a meta- [[system (engineering)]]!
- DOD defines it thus:
	- > A set or arrangement of systems that results when independent and useful systems are integrated into a larger system that delivers unique capabilities.
	- four categories from DOD:
		- **virtual SoS** - these lack a central plan or authority, and are based on emergent behavior
		- **collaborative** - systems have an agreed purpose that they collaborate voluntarily to work toward
		- **acknowledged** - the SoS has a designated owner and staff, but the component systems are still independent
		- **directed** - the SoS is centrally managed. it was planned to be a SoS and built that way.
- a great example SoS would be something like the Internet! many PC, servers, and networking devices, each themselves systems, following a set of standards to produce a bigger system.
- just being [[complex]] doesn't make something a SoS! an airplane is super complicated, but the parts aren't independently useful- an aileron does nothing without being put on a whole plane!
- systems of systems:
	- may have individual parts that were not intended to be part of an SoS when they were built! they often grow organically over time.
	- nowadays, often involve data exchange! web-based or phone-based systems, stuff shipping big data around, etc.
