- resilience can be thought of as a process of positive adaptation to adversity
- human resilience unfolds over time. it's part of the development process
- human resilience depends heavily on social bonds, like parent/child nurturing, or mutual webs of socializing
- resilience isn't the _opposite_ of trauma, vulnerability, or depression. rather, the positive protective measures involved in resilience are distinct from the mechanisms of vulnerability
	- some researchers distinguish *protective* factors (reduce negative outcomes) from *promotive* factor (increase positive outcomes)
- individuals are part of a multi-level [[system]]- themselves as individuals, a family, a city, a nation... resilience mechanisms are sometimes located at a social level rather than solely within an individual
	- see [[panarchy]], which rhymes
