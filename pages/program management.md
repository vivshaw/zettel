- a **program** is "a group of related [[projects]] managed in a coordinated manner"
	- think of it as one meta-level up from [[project management]]!
	- might oversee a team of project managers
- a program manager...
	- balances & estimates resources across projects in the program
	- ensures those projects are aligned with strategic goals and one another
	- handles coordination between teams working on those projects
	- improves project processes within the program
