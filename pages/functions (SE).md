- functions define what the system does
	- they don't specify how it does it! they also don't specify how well it performs.
- a function has an input, the function itself, and an output
- functions are often demonstrated in "boxes-and-arrows" diagrams
- we identify the necessary functions by starting with our [[requirements (SE)]], then going through an iterative process: figure out which tasks need to happen, then figure out the ICOMs (inputs, outputs, constraints, mechanisms) for them, then figure out how they need to connect.
- functions can exist in a heirarchy
