- to compare the benefits of projects that have their benefits at different times in the future, we discount their values to today's dollars (calculate PV).
- for a single cash flow: `PR = FV / (1 + i) ^ N`
	- where
		- `PV` is the present value of the future cash flow
		- `FV` is the future cash flow
		- `i` is the [[discount rate]]
		- `N` is the number of periods
	- this is the same as calculating compound interest:
