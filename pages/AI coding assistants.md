- tips for Cursor:
	- [Use a `project_milestones.md` and `documentation.md` file](https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1hhpqj0/how_i_made_cursor_actually_work_in_a_larger/). ask Cursor to refer to them throughout the process, and to update them at the end of sessions.
		- additionally, make the machine take some time to rest! [add a prompt for "take a breather" and for "get up to speed"](https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1hhpqj0/comment/m2u2dup/).
	- if your `.cursorrules` is not getting you the desired effect, [consider editing it collaboratively with Cursor](https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1hhpqj0/comment/m2tpinx/)
	- [create a logfile for errors and ask Cursor to reference that](https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1hhpqj0/comment/m2u85c2/), rather than pasting errors into chat
