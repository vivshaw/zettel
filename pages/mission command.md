- per the JCS:
	- > Mission command is the conduct of military operations through decentralized execution based upon mission-type orders
	- > Mission command exploits the human element…, emphasizing trust, force of will, initiative, judgment, and creativity.
	- > Successful mission command demands that subordinate leaders at all echelons exercise disciplined initiative and act aggressively and independently to accomplish the mission. They focus their orders on the purpose of the operation rather than on the details of how to perform assigned tasks.
	- > Essential to mission command is the thorough understanding of the commander’s intent at every level of command and a command climate of mutual trust and understanding.
