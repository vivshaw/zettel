- student of [[Anaximander]]
- carried on the theory of the *[[arche]]*, but held that the *arche* was air
	- when air becomes thinner, it becomes hotter, and then fire
	- when it becomes thicker, it becomes wind, then cloud, then water, then earth
	- air is that "from which other things are separated out"- an in-between thing
	- air is invisible, unlike the other substance. so if something infinite surrounds us in all directions, it must be air
	- the soul is air- when a person or animal can't breathe air, they die
- thought the Earth was a disk, riding on air, much like [[Thales of Miletus]]
