- the first noble truth: the truth of suffering, or [[duhkka]]
	- there's a discomfort in our lives. things are never the way we hope they'd be, or that they seem to be. what we experience fundamentally isn't satisfactory. no matter how joyous we are in the moment, we'll someday grow old, sick, and die!
	- think of this as a physician's diagnosis of the symptoms
- the second noble truth: the cause of suffering
	- a [[Theravada]] perspective is that our constant craving for sense-pleasures is the cause. like a thirsty person drinking salt water, we can drink and drink to satisfy our cravings but only get thirstier.
	- think of this as a physician's diagnosis of the root cause
- the thirds noble truth: the truth of cessation
	- our suffering is self-created! since we create it through our negative emotions, we can destroy it.
	- think of this as a physician's prognosis.
- the fourth noble truth: the truth of the path
	- by following the Buddha's path, and seeing the true nature of the mind, we will eliminate suffering.
	- think of this as a physician's treatment plan.
