- the title is often taken as a protest against systematic philosophy
- the work is an exploration of Socrates' role as a teacher
	- how is that possible, if Socrates insists he knows nothing?
	- via [[maieutics]]! Socrates doesn't produce the truth, he helps the student to find the truth within themselves
- the work is about the incarnation of Christ, but Kierkegaard is subtle about it- doesn't explicitly say so
- also introduces the idea of the **absolute paradox**:
	- Socrates claims to be uncertain of his own nature as a human- what if he is a monster like Typhon and does not know it?
	- this is "the desire to discover something that thought itself cannot think"
	- K suggests that we call the unknown "the God"
	- the Incarnation is a paradox of the same sort- the absolute paradox!
	- this stands against [[Hegel]]- there is an absolute difference between human and divine, it's not something mediated
