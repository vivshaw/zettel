- what is a design review?
	- a comprehensive review of the progress of the program
	- you might invite the customer or other trusted third parties
	- check whether the program is appropriately resourced, assess risk
- the design review itself is highly rehearsed. the hard part is all the prep work!
	- gathering info across all the involved engineering disciplines, and amalgamating it into one coherent thing
	- figuring out the current level of compliance with the requirements, and the plans to comply with them in the future
- **system requirements review** (SRR)
	- the purpose of this review is to ensure that the system has the requirements right (they meet the need), they are correctly documented, they are verifiable, and they are consistent with cost, risk, etc
	- make sure that any external interfaces are understood and documented
- **preliminary design review** (PDR)
	- the purpose of this review is to demonstrate technical confidence that the system will satisfy the capability need within the stated cost and schedule
	- also, to assess whether risks have been accounted for and mitigation plans created
	- in the review, start with the lowest-level sub-assembly, then work your way up to the full system
	- after this review, we're ready to move on to detailed design
- **critical design review** (CDR)
	- the purpose of this review is to demonstrate to stakeholders that every part of the system has a reasonable expectation of meeting the system requirements.
	- we do this with testing and analysis, as we're not yet ready for demonstration. but we do test real components, as opposed to the PDR's use of only analysis and judgment.
	- most of our designs should be released before we're ready for CDR! it represents "pencils down" for engineering- we move from design to execution
	- this establishes the initial product baseline, and afterwards we're ready to start building
