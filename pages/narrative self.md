- the **narrative self** is the self as the subject of the story of one's life
	- we are fundamentally sense-making creatures- "*homo narans*"
	- the self is constructed out of a multitude of remember details, values, & plans, that hang together as a coherent narrative whole
	- narrative structure is [[teleological]]- a story is meaningful in virtue of it's progression through the story arc until its end
	- we can draw some distinction between the slightly different views "the self as a story" and "the self as a character" - it can be that we think of ourselves as characters, and use stories to understand ourselves, but not that there's One Big Unitive Story that is our life
- this is a distinct axis of explanation from theories of personal identity like [[animalism]] or [[psychological continuity]]. these explain "what makes me me?" in the same sense as "what makes this billiard ball this billiard ball?"- it's distinct in spatiotemporal location and properties. but that doesn't say anything about how I came to be the person I am
- Strawson thinks not all of us are narrativists- he divides us into **diachronics**, who do think of ourselves as beings that existed in the past and will exist into the future, and **episodics**, who do not.
	- e.g., Meursault from Camus' "The Stranger", who sees no contradiction in attending a comdey the day after the death of his mother
	- ref: [Against Narrativity](https://lchc.ucsd.edu/mca/Paper/against_narrativity.pdf) #papers
- the Buddhist doctrine of [[anatta]] also rejects the narrative self
- there's a sense in which the narrative self is a particularly Western and romantic one
- ties into the [end of history illusion](https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_the_psychology_of_your_future_self)- we think our lives are a story ending in us becoming the person we were meant to be, have now become, and always will be. but that's not true- we change drastically more than we think, throughout our lives!
	- this leads to irrational choices! llike:

	- this might be caused by the ease of remembering, versus the difficulty of imagining. it's easier to picture our pasts than our futures.
- in literature:
	- > All the worldâ€™s a stage,
	  And all the men and women merely players;
	  They have their exits and their entrances;
	  And one man in his time plays many parts,
	  His acts being seven ages.
	  "*As You Like It*", Shakespeare
