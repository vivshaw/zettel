- `product costs = direct materials costs + direct labor costs + MOH (manufacturing overhead costs)`
	- there are multiple types of MOH as well:
		- Indirect material costs- cleaning supplies, machine oil
		- Indirect labor costs- supervisors, drivers, cleaning staff
		- Other costs- equipment depreciation, insurance, property taxes
- simplest way to estimate MOH- **job-cost analysis:**
	- you can't calculate exactly how many watts of electricity went to each job, what percentage of the tax, etc. so MOH is allocated using a measurable *basis*- commonly labor hours or machine hours. you pick a basis, divide your _total_ overhead costs by the basis, and that gets you the _MOH rate_, which you can multiple each job's use of the basis by to get its share of the overhead.
	- choose a basis matching the primary cost driver for the product
- more advanced method- **activity-based cost analysis**
	- the ABC method for calculating overhead breaks a job into individual tasks and calculates costs for each, giving a more granular estimate. this is more effortful than job-cost analysis, but more accurate.
	- split a factory's work into steps, determine the cost driver for each step, then pick an appropriate basis for that cost driver and calculate an overhead rate for it. now you can calculate the overhead for each step of a given job, and sum them
