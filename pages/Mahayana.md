- Mahayana Buddhism is focused on the teachings and scriptures of [[the Buddha]], similarly to [[Theravada]]- but it accepts a much larger canon of scripture
- Mahayana emphasize the path of the [[bodhisattva]], ones devoted to helping all sentient beings
- Mahayana generally believes that there are many Buddhas and bodhisattvas- perhaps an infinite number!
- metaphorically, we can say that Mahayana folks see [[kleshas]] like a toxic plant- but one with an antidote. we can't always avoid it, it will keep growing back, but we can keep ourselves safe when it does.
	- or, the kleshas can be counteracted with beneficial things like the [[paramitas]]
