- [[Andrew Ng]]'s version:
	- **scoping**
		- define the project
			- what are we working on?
			- key success metrics: [[accuracy]], [[latency]], [[throughput]]
			- estimate the resources you need
	- **data**
		- define your data and establish a baseline
			- is the data labeled consistently?
			- how do you perform [[normalization]]?
		- label and organize your data
	- **modeling**
		- select and train your model
			- code/algorithm + hyperparameters + data = ML model
				- in research, we tend to hold the data fixed and vary the code and hyperparameters (e.g. working with known benchmark datasets)
				- in practice, it can help to hold the code fixed and optimize the data!
		- perform error analysis
	- **deployment**
		- deploy in production
			- local software on edge device? or centralized serving?
			- what other software/hardware is needed to run and feed your model? (e.g., speech recognition needs a microphone and [[VAD]] module)
		- monitor & maintain the system
			- check for [[concept drift & data drift]]
	- ml is iterative! any of these steps may uncover problems and lead you to jump back to an earlier step to iterate.
- [[Chip Huyen]]'s version, from [[Designing Machine Learning Systems]]:
	- **project scoping**
		- lay out your goals, objectives, and constraints. estimate and allocate your resources. identify your business stakeholders and get them involved.
	- **data engineering**
		- generate tidy, useful training data that fits your project out of raw data
	- **ML model development**
		- extract features, and develop initial models using those features
		- this is the step that requires the most ML expertise
	- **deployment**
		- make your model available to users!
	- **monitoring and continual learning**
		- monitor for performance decay, and update to meet needs of the changing environment
	- **business analysis**
		- now, is your model having the business impact you expected? compare it against business goals and look for business insights.
