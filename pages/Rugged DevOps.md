- an approach to building software similar to [[DevSecOps]], in that it bakes durability in the face of hardship into the software development cycle
- ## [The Rugged Manifesto](https://ruggedsoftware.org/)
	- I am rugged and, more importantly, my code is rugged.
	- I recognize that software has become a foundation of our modern world.
	- I recognize the awesome responsibility that comes with this foundational role.
	- I recognize that my code will be used in ways I cannot anticipate, in ways it was not designed, and for longer than it was ever intended.
	- I recognize that my code will be attacked by talented and persistent adversaries who threaten our physical, economic, and national security.
	- I recognize these things - and I choose to be rugged.
	- I am rugged because I refuse to be a source of vulnerability or weakness.
	- I am rugged because I assure my code will support its mission.
	- I am rugged because my code can face these challenges and persist in spite of them.
	- I am rugged, not because it is easy, but because it is necessary and I am up for the challenge.
