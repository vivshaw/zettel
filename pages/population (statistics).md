- a **population** is the group of all items with a common characteristic we want to research.
- it is rarely possible to measure the entire population. so instead, we use [[sampling]].
- the **target population** is the total population, across the universe. the **research population** is the portion of it we have access to. we need to ensure that the research population is representative of the target population, if we wish to draw conclusions about it.
