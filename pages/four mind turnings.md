- reflection on the precious human body
	- we have the eight precious freedoms. conversely, we weren't born into any of the 8 unfree states.
		- we weren't born in the hellish realms
		- we weren't born in the hungry ghost realms
		- we weren't born in the animal realms
	- only because we have these freedoms, we can encounter and practice the [[dharma]]
