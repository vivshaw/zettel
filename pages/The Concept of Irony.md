- examines various types of subjectivism and relativism that are used as critiques of tradition. Like, "oh, that law isn't a universal moral law, it's just relative"
- Kierkegaard calls these tendencies *irony*
	- contrasts [[Socratic irony]] with the irony of the modern [[Romantic]]s of his time
	- Kierkegaard lauds Socrates, but not the Romantics. what's the difference?
- **Pt. 1 - The Position of Socrates Viewed as Irony**
	- compares the positive portrayal of [[Socrates]] in [[Plato]] and [[Xenophon]], to the parody in [[Aristophanes]]' [[The Clouds]]
	- to Kierkagaard, Socrates has no position of his own. he exists to contradict others, but doesn't present a doctrine with concrete positive content. his project is a negative one
	- Xenophon's portrayal of *daimon* vs. Plato's:
		- Xenophon portrayed it as commanding as well as warning-against, Plato as only warning-against
		- K sides with Plato- the *daimon* is negative
	- the *daimon* **was** in conflict with Greek religion
		- it substitutes the abstract and individual daimon, for the concrete universals of the gods
		- it speaks only of Socrates and his friends, but not of the *polis* and the world
	- **Hegel's View of Socrates**
		- [[Hegel]] was wildly influential and important at this time, and Kierkegaard built off Hegel's interpretation in [[Lectures on the History of Philosophy]]
		- yet Hegel was wrong in trying to explain [[Socratic irony]] as something other than irony, and instead about making the abstract concrete through supposing it has an unknown essence, etc. etc.
		- Hegel didn't try to reconcile the three contemporary accounts! and Hegel ignored the phenomenal aspect of Socrates life
	- > As a rule, irony is understood ideally, is assigned its place as a vanishing element in the system, and is therefore treated very briefly. For this reason it is not easy to comprehend how a whole life can be taken up with it, since, after all, the content of this life must be regarded as nothing. But we forget that a position is never as ideal in life as it is in the system; we forget that irony, just as any other position in life, has its spiritual trials, its battles, its retreats, its victories.
	- also challenges [[Schleiermacher]]'s view of Socrates
	- Socrates' negative view of the state- to Socrates, the judges' condemnation simply means that so-and-so many individuals have condemned him. effectively, the state doesn't exist for him
	- Socrates as the birth of inwardness, [[subjectivity]]
	- Sophistry as a *positive* project- as the Sophists would tear everything down with doubt, only to then justify anything with rhetoric, effectively "everything is true"
		- casuistry thus likened to Sophistry, the Pharisees as well
	- irony has "world-historical validity"- Socrates' irony was valid as a reaction to the cultural circumstance he lived in
- **Pt. 2 - The Validity of Irony**
	- compares modern irony, in the German [[Romantic]]s, to Socrates
		- the Romantics use irony to tear down modern bourgeois culture, but offer no alternative
	- discusses Hegel's theory of irony as "infinite absolute negativity"
		- > Here, then, we have irony as the infinite absolute negativity. It is negativity, because it only negates; it is infinite, because it does not negate this or that phenomenon; it is absolute, because that by virtue of which it negates is a higher something that still is not. The irony establishes nothing, because that which is to be established lies behind it. It is a divine madness that rages like a Tamerlane and does not leave one stone upon another.
		  *pp.261*
	- posits irony as maintaining the contradiction between phenomenon and essence, exterior and interior
	- contrasts irony with
		- dissimulation
			- that aims to achieve an outside purpose. irony is for its own sake.
		- doubt
			- the doubter wants to achieve the object of doubt, and is unhappy that he can't. the ironist wants to get outside the object of irony.
		- religious devotion
			- the "all is vanity" of faith is universal, including the subject
			- the vanity of existence makes way for the eternal order of the religious
	- > In irony, however, since everything is shown to be vanity, the subject becomes free. The more vain everything becomes, all the lighter, emptier, and volatilized the subject becomes. And while everything is in the process of becoming vanity, the ironic subject does not become vain in his own eyes but rescues his own vanity. For irony, everything becomes nothing [...]
	  *pp.258*
	- irony as an alienation of the subject from actuality
		- > If we turn back to the foregoing general description of irony as infinite absolute negativity, it is adequately suggested therein that irony is no longer directed against this or that particular phenomenon, against a particular existing thing, but that the whole of existence has become alien to the ironic subject and the ironic subject in turn alien to existence, that as actuality has lost its validity for the ironic subject, he himself has to a certain degree become unactual. The word "actuality," however, must here primarily be understood as historical actuality-that is, the given actuality at a certain time and in a certain situation.
		  *pp.259*
	- an interestingly [[dialectical]] view of world history:
		- > Herein lies the profoundly tragic aspect of world history. At one and the same time, an individual may be world-historically justified and yet unauthorized. Insofar as he is the latter, he must become a sacrifice; insofar as he is the former, he must prevail-that is, he must prevail by becoming a sacrifice. Here we see how intrinsically consistent the world process is, for as the more true actuality presses onward, it nevertheless itself esteems the past; it is not a revolution but an evolution. The past actuality shows itself to be still justified by demanding a sacrifice, the new actuality by providing a sacrifice. But a sacrifice there must be, because a new element must actually emerge, since the new actuality is not just a conclusion to the past but contains something more in itself; it is not a mere corrective of the past but is also a new beginning.
		  *pp.260*
	- on [[Fichte]]:
		- > Here we perceive that this irony was not in the service of the world spirit. It was not an element of the given actuality that must be negated and superseded by a new element, but it was all of historical actuality that it negated in order to make room for a self-created actuality. It was not subjectivity that should forge ahead here, since subjectivity was already given in world situations, but it was an exaggerated subjectivity, a subjectivity raised to the second power. We also perceive here that this irony was totally unjustified and that Hegel's hostile behavior toward it is entirely in order.
		  *pp.275*
		- Fichte tried to overcome the phenomenon/noumenon distinction from [[Kant]]- Kant separates the content (from the [[thing-in-itself]]) and form (from the [[categories (philosophy)]]), but Fichte thinks this is wrong- there's no need to posit an external thing-in-itself
		- > When Fichte infinitized the I in this way, he advanced an idealism beside which any actuality turned pale.
		  *pp.273*
		- Fichte is in fact an advancement over Kant, by bringing in negativity. Much like Socrates!
		- negation is _necessary_, "since everyone who wants to save his soul must lose it"
	- on the [[Romantics]], e.g. [[Schlegel]] and [[Tieck]]:
		- they distorted Fichte's theory, by applying it wrongly!
		- > In the first place, the empirical and finite I was confused with the eternal I; in the second place, metaphysical actuality was confused with historical actuality.
		- Fichte's **I = I** was an abstract, theoretical entity. the Romantics replaced it with their own I, the I of a concrete person
		- the Romantics' criticism is indiscriminate! they are not world-historically justified
		- [[Hegel]]'s critique is totally correct!
		- there's nothing substantial about the ironist's life, no past or history to ground them.
		- the ironist treats himself inauthentically, as a poetic character acting through life aesthetically, but unable to ever be satisfied as irony abandons the actual
			- > If we ask what poetry is, we may say in general that it is victory over the world; it is through a negation of the imperfect actuality that poetry opens up a higher actuality
		- the ironist has nothing but his moods to guide him
		- > Boredom is the only continuity the ironist has
		- Kierkegaard treats Schlegel's Lucinde as a rejection of _all ethics_, not just a critique of the elements of bourgeois morality that's worthy of criticism. it's purpose is freedom and emancipation from flawed standards, but what you get in return is slavery to the natural drives and sensual pleasure. that's not a higher freedom at all!
- **Irony As a Controlled Element - the Truth of Irony**
	- Kierkegaard's own view of irony
	- brings up authors that he thinks have used irony correctly- [[Goethe]], [[Shakespeare]], [[Heiberg]]
	- these writers have a consistent, overarching worldview that structures their thought. they use irony as an individual element in service of a greater purpose.
	- what about in personal life, rather than art? one should generally live according to their society's traditions and ethics, but not uncritically- isolate the individual aspects that are flawed and expose those.
		- > In our age, there has been much talk about the importance of doubt for science and scholarship but what doubt is to science, irony is to personal life. Just as scientists maintain that there is no true science without doubt, so it may be maintained with the same right that no genuinely human life is possible without irony.
		  *pp.326*
	- > [...] knowledge not only about the secrets of the human race but even about the secrets of God is offered for sale at such a bargain price today that it all looks very dubious. In our joy over the achievement in our age, we have forgotten that an achievement is worthless if it is not made one's own.
	  *pp.327*
	- > Irony as the negative is the way, it is not the truth but the way.
