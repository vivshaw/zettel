- just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing tries to meet demand in the most efficient way possible, by:
	- only manufacturing goods that have in fact been ordered
	- focusing on efficiency of producrtion
	- reducing waste materials
	- driving productivity with [[continuous improvement]] methods
- the ideas were kicked off by [[Toyota]] and the [[TPS]] in th 50's and 60's
- this idea would later catch on in software engineering as well, when [[Java]] adopted the term for its [[just-in-time compilation]]
