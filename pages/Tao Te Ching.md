	  > With the greatest leader above them, people barely know one exists.
	  Next comes one whom they love and praise.
	  Next comes one whom they fear.
	  Next comes one whom they despise and defy.
	  When a leader trusts no one, no one trusts him.
	  The great leader speaks little.
	  He never speaks carelessly.
	  He works without self-interest and leaves no trace.
	  When all is finished, the people say, “We did it ourselves.”
