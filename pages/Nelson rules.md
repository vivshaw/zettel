- a set of rules for assessing whether a process is in control via its [[control chart]], from Nelson (1984)
- **1 - outside limits rule**
	- any point outside the control limits of 3 [[standard deviation]]s.
- **2 - run rule**
	- whether ~8 points in a row are above or below the centerline. (you might use 7 for a chart of <25 points, or 9 for >=40.)
- **3 - trend rule**
	- whether 6 points in a row are consecutively increasing or decreasing
- **4- alternating values rule**
	- whether 14 points in a row alternate above and below the centerline
- **5 - zone A rule**
	- \>=2 out of 3 in a row are in Zone A (>2 [[standard deviation]]s) in the same direction
- **6 - zone B rule**
	- \>=4 out of 5 in a row are in Zone B (>1 [[standard deviation]]) in the same direction
- **7 - lack of variability rule**
	- 15 consecutive points are within Zone C, the center third (<=1 [[standard deviation]])
	- this is often due to an issue with subgrouping.
- **8 - process mixture rules**
	- 8 points in a row are outside Zone C
