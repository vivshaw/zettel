alias:: planful opportunism

- an approach to business strategy in a world of uncertainty and competition, based on planning only what can be planned, and building both alignment and autonomy for teams to tackle the unpredictability independently as it happens.
	- this borrows from *[[Auftragstaktik]]* and [[mission command]] in the realm of military strategy, but adapts it to the world of modern business.
- rather than making detailed plans and exercising fine control over their execution, we set and communicate clear goals, then give people the autonomy to pursue those goals in whatever way they discover to be most effective. we cultivate [[independent thinking obedience]] and adjust our plans to the situation at the closest point to where a decision needs to be made.
- from The Art of Action:
	- > 1. **DECIDE WHAT REALLY MATTERS**
	  You cannot create perfect plans, so do not attempt to do so. Do not plan beyond the circumstances you can foresee. Instead, use the knowledge which is accessible to you to work out the outcomes you really want the organization to achieve. Formulate your strategy as an intent rather than a plan.
	- > 2. **GET THE MESSAGE ACROSS**
	  Having worked out what matters most now, pass the message on to others and give them responsibility for carrying out their part in the plan. Keep it simple. Don’t tell people what to do and how to do it. Instead, be as clear as you can about your intentions. Say what you want people to achieve and, above all, tell them why. Then ask them to tell you what they are going to do as a result.
	- > 3. **GIVE PEOPLE SPACE AND SUPPORT**
	  Do not try to predict the effects your actions will have, because you can’t. Instead, encourage people to adapt their actions to realize the overall intention as they observe what is actually happening. Give them boundaries which are broad enough to take decisions for themselves and act on them.
- to be effective, this process needs to be cascaded across all levels of the organization, it needs to repeat over time, and it needs to be paired with training and culture-building.
- [[strategy briefs]] are a tool that can help to implement directed opportunism.
