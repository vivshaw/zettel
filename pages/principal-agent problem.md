- the [principal-agent problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem) occurs when one entity (the principal) hires another (the agent) to take action on its behalf. since both have different utility functions, and different information, they won't be fully [[aligned]] . the cost to the principal for this is called "agency cost".
	- this worsens when the principal can't punish the agent for deviation
	- can use various methods to increase alignment- profit sharing, performance measurement, termination, commissions
- this is kind of similar to Bungay's "Three Gaps" in [[The Art of Action]]!
