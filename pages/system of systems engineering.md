- SoS engineering differs in a number of ways from regular ol' [[systems engineering]]
- requirements:
	- there will be requirements both at the SoS level, and the system level
	- at the SoS level, they're likely to be much broader or vaguer, specified in terms of capabilities of the underlying systems rather than detailed specs. the systems engineers working on the subsystems will then need to work with the SoS engineer to translate these into detailed reqs
	- at the SoS level, they're more likely to change over time as the SoS evolves
- system relationships:
	- not all parts of the SoS may be under control of the SoS team! you might have to collaborate with folks who work independently, or just deal with what you get
	- it might not be possible to identify _every_ system that affects the SoS
	- you may need to synchronize the systems engineering process across different systems
- testing:
	- it can be harder to assess performance- you need truly end-to-end metrics for your SoS
	- but in some other ways it can be easier! your SoS may be partially comprised of systems that are already out in the field. if so, you get to leverage your operational experience with those systems
- risk management:
	- since you might not have control over ever part, you need to anticipate and be ready to deal with changes you can't control
