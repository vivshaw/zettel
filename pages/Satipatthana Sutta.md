- suggests the **four foundations of mindfulness** as the way to overcome suffering and grief:
	- contemplating the body in the body
	- contemplating feelings in feelings
	- contemplating consciousness in consciousness
	- contemplating mental objects in mental objects
	- these have an interesting recursive/self-referential structure!
- # 1. Contemplation of the Body
	- begins with mindfulness of breathing
	- then, to mindfulness of the postures of the body
	- then, to mindfulness with clear comprehension
	- next, to reflection on the body and its anatomical parts as base objects:
		- > Just as if there were a double-mouthed provision bag full of various kinds of grain such as hill paddy, paddy, green gram, cow-peas, sesamum, and husked rice, and a man with sound eyes, having opened that bag, were to take stock of the contents thus: "This is hill paddy, this is paddy, this is green gram, this is cow-pea, this is sesamum, this is husked rice." Just so, monks, a monk reflects on this very body enveloped by the skin and full of manifold impurity, from the soles up, and from the top of the head-hairs down, thinking thus: "There are in this body hair of the head, hair of the body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, marrow, kidney, heart, liver, midriff, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, gorge, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, nasal mucus, synovial fluid, urine."
		- might this be the origin of [[body scan]] meditation?
		- cultivate an attitude of [[non-attachment]] to each of these parts
	- next, to contemplation of the material elements in the body
		- > And further, monks, a monk reflects on this very body, however it be placed or disposed, by way of the material elements: "There are in this body the element of earth, the element of water, the element of fire, the element of wind."
		  Just as if, monks, a clever cow-butcher or his apprentice, having slaughtered a cow and divided it into portions, should be sitting at the junction of four high roads, in the same way, a monk reflects on this very body, as it is placed or disposed, by way of the material elements: "There are in this body the elements of earth, water, fire, and wind."
		- reflect on: how each of these elements is empty of self. how each is changing and impermanent. how each is not truly owned or controlled by us. how there is no essential distinction between the element in the body, and the element outside the body. how the body is constantly reliant on a supply of elements from outside.
