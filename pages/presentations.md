- wisdom from a coworker:
	- assume 1 slide = 1 hour of prep time = 1 minute of conference talk
	- try to throw in a "palate cleanser" every 5-10 minutes. that can be a joke slide, a slide with a different background color, some multimedia aspect, etc. something to recapture the audience's attention
	- use a _lot_ of lampposts. tell the audience where you've been and where you're going on a regular basis
	- all presentations should have a narrative structure. I like to put the audience in the role of the hero in the story. but you can put yourself in that role too for something like an experience report. still, the general structure of "you have this problem -> here are things that didn't solve that problem -> here's something that does -> here's you being forever changed for the better" is good #narrativity
	- some people will start reading your slides and forget to listen to you. so try to minimize the amount of information visible at a single point in time that distracts from what you are trying to say
	- there are enough good options out there to generate "nice enough" looking slides from markdown that it's not usually worth a bunch of time customizing the look and feel
