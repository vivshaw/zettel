- when a piece of equipment is purchased, that can be accounted for in two ways:
	- **expensing:** the full amount is "expensed" on the [[income statement]] in the year of purchase
		- typically used for small purchases (<$1000) with a useful lifetime under a year
	- **capitalizing:** the equipment is purchased, but the value is spread out over its useful life. each year, a portion of the value is expensed on the [[income statement]]
		- typically used for larger purchases and longer-lived assets
