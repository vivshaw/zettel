- a financial measure of how a tangible asset loses value over time
- for intangible assets, see [[amortization]]
- **accumulated depreciation** is the total amount of depreciation and amortization at a point in time
- what can be depreciated?
	- assets used strictly for business
	- assets having a useful life over 1 year
	- assets whose value decreases over time
- accounting terminology:
	- value of an asset: **book value**
	- initial cost: **cost basis**
	- useful life of the asset: **recovery period**
	- sale price after the useful life ends: **salvage value**
- when I purchase an asset, where is that tracked?
	- the decreasing value of the asset is tracked in the company's [[balance sheet]]
	- the *amount* of the decrease is tracked on the [[income statement]]
	- the amount of cash spent is tracked on the [[cash flow statement]]
- methods of calculating depreciation in the US:
	- pre-1981 tax code:
		- **the SL (Straight Line) method:** depreciation is uniform over the recovery period.
			- depreciation expense = (cost basis - salvage value) / recovery period
			- still used for intangible assets nowadays!
		- **the DB (Declining Balance) method:** depreciation is a fixed % of the book value over the recovery period
			- DB method: depreciation rate = 150% / recovery period
			- double DB method: 20)% / recovery period
			- deprecation expense = rate * previous year's book value
			- ⚠️this method never reaches 0! to fix this, accountants can swap from DB to SL when the depreciation expense from SL exceeds DB. calculated as remaining balance before the switch / remaining lifetime of the asset
	- post-1986 tax code:
		- **the MACRS (Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System) method:** depreciation is a combination of both
			- outlined in [IRS Publication 946](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-946)
				- equipment and activities are sorted into "asset classes"
				- each asset class has a predefined recovery period, ranging from 3 to 39 years
				- salvage values are assumed to be 0
				- a schedule exists for each year of depreciation
				- a 1/2-year convention was adopted- only half a year of depreciation happens in the first year, and an extra year is added at the end with another half year
			- this removes guesswork about asset lifetime, salvage value, etc., standardizing it across the US
			- MACRS starts with a DB or DDB approach, then swaps to SL to ensure we hit 0.
	- 2018-2027:
		- **bonus depreciation:** expense the entire cost of the asset in year 1
			- created as a stimulus measure to encourage large capital expenses
			- started at 100% bonus depreciation from 2018-2022, and is currently ramping down 20% per year 2023-2027.
- what if an asset is sold?
	- if sold above its book value, then you generate a [[capital gain]], called a **depreciation recapture**
	- if sold below book value, that's a capital loss, and is tax-deductible
