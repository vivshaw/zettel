- if "I will drink wine tomorrow" is contingently true, but God (necessarily, eternally) knows I will do it, then isn't it *necessarily* true?
- addressed first by [[Aristotle]], then later by [[Boethius]], [[Duns Scotus]] (in turn starting to develop a more modern [[modal logic]])
- [[Maimonides]] addressed it with [[apophatic theology]]- we don't and can't know how God knows the future, just that he does and it is unlike human knowings.
	- [[Gersonides]] rejects this, and suggests that God's knowledge is limited!
		- God knows all events "in so far as they are ordered and determined", but doesn't know them as particulars. He knows his plan that sets all things in determined motion, but not each particular that results. broad laws, not specific occurrences
		- humans can *resist* that determined plan by using their will. God knows _that_ we can each do this, but not _whether_- that is up to us
