- similar in some ways to [[perseverence]] and [[psychological resilience]], but not identical!
- > A plastic personality trait which determines, in some part, how individuals respond when exposed to stressors, pressure, opportunity, and challenge, irrespective of the prevailing situation.
  (Clough & Strycharczyk, 2011)
- the fact that it's plastic means you can change it! you can learn to build more toughness.
- one model: **four C's, eight factors**:
	- **control:** life control, emotional control
	- **commitment:** achievement oriented, goal oriented
	- **confidence:** confidence in abilities, interpersonal confidence
	- **challenge:** risk orientation, learning orientation
	- you might prefer this model over grit or resilience because it encompasses more factors! grit is basically life control + goal orientation, and resilience is basically commitment + control. this adds confidence and challenge.
