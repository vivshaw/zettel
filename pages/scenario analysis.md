- instead of preparing a single forecast for a situation, prepare three:
	- a **base case**, your best estimate
	- a **best case**, an estimate of what m ight happen if everything went perfectly
	- a **worst case**, an estimate of the worst reasonable outcome
- now that your estimate is bracketed with a better and worse case, you can make a more informed decision based on your risk appetite, and make plans to reduce the likelihood of the worst case
