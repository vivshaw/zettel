- **collaborative robots** are designed to work together with humans. they monitor the space around them to avoid collisions.
- there are four levels of collaboration:
	- **coexistence**: humans and robots working on separate tasks in a shared area
	- **sequential**: humans and robots working on separate steps in a shared process
	- **cooperation**: humans and robots working on the same thing simultaneously
	- **responsive**: the robot responds in real-time to the actions of the human
