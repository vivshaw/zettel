- a dialogoue on the nature of piety and justic
- opens with Socrates accused of corrupting the youth of Athens, of impiety, of inventing new gods and neglecting the proper gods, because he says he receives divine revelation
- Euthyphro is trying a case before the king against his own father. a laborer murdered another, and his father murdered the murderer, because he feels that's the just thing to do
- Euthyphro's take:
	- **justice is piety**
	- **what's beloved by the gods is pious, and what is not beloved by them is impious**
	- **piety is attending to the gods, and the rest of justice is attending to man**
- Socrates' take:
	- **but the gods disagree over what is just and unjust!**
	- **is the loved pious because it is loved, or is it loved because it's pious?**
	- **justice and piety are not synonyms, but piety is only part of justice**
	- **attending to the gods just means doing what is beloved by them, so it can't both be that piety is attending to the gods, but piety is only part of justice**
- if Euthyphro doesn't know what piety is, how can he be just in prosecuting his father, much less how can he help Socrates defeat a charge of impiety?
