- **Preface**
	- starts with an analysis of [[Rommel]]'s success in [[WWII]]. some had falsely thought that military success was owed to national character, some inherent superiority of the Germans as a people. that's obviously not the case (and views like that led to horrible consequences, not success!). others thought it owed to individuals- perhaps he was a brilliant [[great man]] who changed the tide of war. but what if it's neither of those things? what if it's all about organization and practice?
		- > I began to work on the hypothesis that it was not nations or individuals that mattered, but the German Army as an organization. I looked at how it performed elsewhere, examined its equipment and organization, and then its approach to command and control. Here, some lights began to go on. I tracked things back in time, down increasingly obscure paths leading to officer selection and training and other good old-fashioned HR stuff, which in turn led to behavioral and cultural norms developed in the nineteenth century. The answer became clear: Rommel had inherited an intelligent organization in which the characteristics he displayed were inculcated in every officer. He was superb at running it – but it had been created by somebody else, many decades before. And that creator was a Prussian.
	- why does this touchy-feely organizational stuff matter? well, if the the least touchy-feely place around cares about it, the military- then probably there's a reason!
		- > Strategy was hard-nosed stuff, understood in terms of analysis and a calculator. Organization was “touchy-feely,” soft stuff understood in terms of human behavior and judgment. However, in the back of my mind was the thought that the real hard men in the military took the soft stuff very seriously. They seemed to believe that success came from bringing the hard calculating and soft motivational sides together. They also seemed to believe that the soft stuff was more difficult than the hard stuff. They talked a lot about leadership; so did people in business. I wanted to go back and take a closer look.
	- strategy is not a [[science]] , not a steady progress of empirical investigation and improvement- but an [[art]] .
		- > I had become convinced that creating great organizations and devising great strategies is not a science but an art. In science our knowledge grows and builds on the past. There is progression. The sum of scientific understanding is greater today than in the past. In contrast in art, there are peaks and troughs over time. There is no progression. Artists today are not better than Leonardo or Michelangelo. So it is with organizational development and strategy. Commanders today are not better than Julius Caesar or Napoleon. Things that have been mastered are forgotten. Each generation has to relearn old lessons and acquire old skills. They just apply the same principles to new situations. To learn the art of strategy and the art of creating organizations capable of executing strategy, we have to study the past and develop our skills through practice.
- **1. The Problem**- "What do you want me to do?"
  collapsed:: true
	- *"The intelligence of an organization is never equal to the sum of the intelligence of the people within it"*
	- here, we investigate what the problem is. why do strategies so often fail? why are organizations so bad at strategizing?
	- Bungay profiles two businesses. the first, an entrepreneurial, devolved, decentralized organization, with a grand new strategy. but that strategy just isn't translating into results. people were doing a lot, but it wasn't moving the needle. and nobody knew what this knew strategy really meant they ought to *do*!
		- > There were a few questions about what was going to be done about this or that. Then over on the left a woman took the wandering microphone. She was responsible for a sizeable chunk of the business. “I understand the strategy,” she said. “I agree with it. I think it’s a good one, perhaps the only possible one. We have talked about it a lot and communicated it down the line. There are lots of initiatives. But…” – here she paused slightly – “what do you want me to do?”
		- people _knew_ the organization was failing to accomplish what it should, but all attempts to find out why just worsened the problem
		- and so, a drive toward top-down guidance arose. if people don't know what to do, then gosh darn it, why not tell them? why not create clear top-down directives and metrics for success?
		- and yet, no luck, no matter how many metrics and initiatives were created. nobody had clear accountability. people had responsibility without control. everyone started to give up.
	- turns out, figuring out what to do ain't easy! we need to understand the cause and effect if we want to get anywhere.
		- > We should not confuse the set of symptoms with the disease. If the observed effects are systemic, then the underlying causes must also be systemic and must be understood as a whole. It is a truism that in a complex system like the human body, an observed effect, like a yellowing of the skin, may indicate a problem in an internal organ such as the liver. It is no good sending the patient to a dermatologist. We have to understand a little, at least, of how the causal system works, and then choose the point or points at which to intervene to alter the system as a whole. Answering that simple question “What do you want me to do?” is quite a problem.
	- so... how _do_ we get things done? that's easy- perhaps dangerously easy. but getting the _right_ things done, that's hard! in fact, it's widely recognized to be hard, and it's endured for decades. but how?
		- > Generating activity is not a problem; in fact it is easy. The fact that it is easy makes the real problem harder to solve. The problem is getting the right things done – the things that matter, the things that will have an impact, the things a company is trying to achieve to ensure success. A high volume of activity often disguises a lack of effective action. We can mistake quantity for quality and then add to it, which merely makes things worse.
	- why does this problem continue to stick around, even if we know what it is and want to fix it? two reasons:
		- 1. we fall prey to the spectre of [[Taylorism]]. we think of management as a science, engineering, a machine. but it isn't.
			- > The first is that the history of management thinking has built up barriers to adopting the solution. Management thinking has its origins in nineteenth-century science. It saw business organizations as machines, and the management model it adopted was grounded in engineering. While this view has been disavowed by modern management thinkers, its legacy is insidious.
		- 2. because we don't understand a clear alternative, we instinctually fall back on [[Taylorism]] even when we're trying not to!
			- > The second reason is that although the failings of the legacy model are clear, it is not clear what it should be replaced with. Lacking an alternative, practicing managers fall back on the engineering model as a default. They often do so without knowing it, because it is so fundamental. They end up with deep-seated problems they cannot address because they are as unaware of the origins of those problems as of the alternative on offer.
	- thinkers like [[Peter Drucker]], [[Douglas McGregor]] called out the critical flaws with Taylorism. but there's still a core that was meaningful. after we're done ditching the bathwater, we can "extract the baby".
		- > We are left with two babies: the understanding that people can indeed regulate themselves if they are committed to some objectives; and the understanding that objectives do need to be set in some way or other.
	- ok, so what problems do we concretely face in turning strategy into action? well, we have plans to achieve outcomes, and we take actions to fulfil those plans. but in a [[VUCA]] world, things never turn out quite as we think. so there are [[Three Gaps]]:
		- **a gap between plans and outcomes**
			- > The gap between plans and outcomes concerns knowledge: It is the difference between what we would like to know and what we actually know. It means that we cannot create perfect plans.
			  #uncertainty
		- **a gap between plans and actions**
			- > The gap between plans and actions concerns alignment: It is the difference between what we would like people to do and what they actually do. It means that even if we encourage them to switch off their brains, we cannot know enough about them to program them perfectly.
			  #alignment
		- **a gap between actions and outcomes**
			- > The gap between actions and outcomes concerns effects: It is the difference between what we hope our actions will achieve and what they actually achieve. We can never fully predict how the environment will react to what we do. It means that we cannot know in advance exactly what outcomes the actions of our organization are going to create.
			  #uncertainty
	- even if we don't understand these gaps, we confront them often in practice. but our intuitive reactions are generally to do the exact opposite of what would be helpful.
		- > Faced with a lack of knowledge, it seems logical to seek more detailed information. Faced with a problem of alignment, it feels natural to issue more detailed instructions. And faced with disappointment in the effects being achieved, it is quite understandable to impose more detailed controls. Unfortunately, these reactions do not solve the problem. In fact, they make it worse.
	- so... what should we do instead? we can boil it down into 3 principles. these are the core of the book's lesson. if you take away nothing else, pay attention to these.
		- > 1. **DECIDE WHAT REALLY MATTERS**
		  You cannot create perfect plans, so do not attempt to do so. Do not plan beyond the circumstances you can foresee. Instead, use the knowledge which is accessible to you to work out the outcomes you really want the organization to achieve. Formulate your strategy as an intent rather than a plan.
		- > 2. **GET THE MESSAGE ACROSS**
		  Having worked out what matters most now, pass the message on to others and give them responsibility for carrying out their part in the plan. Keep it simple. Don’t tell people what to do and how to do it. Instead, be as clear as you can about your intentions. Say what you want people to achieve and, above all, tell them why. Then ask them to tell you what they are going to do as a result.
		- > 3. **GIVE PEOPLE SPACE AND SUPPORT**
		  Do not try to predict the effects your actions will have, because you can’t. Instead, encourage people to adapt their actions to realize the overall intention as they observe what is actually happening. Give them boundaries which are broad enough to take decisions for themselves and act on them.
	- we're gonna look at military history to learn more. but... why?
		- > One benefit of moving far away in time and looking at the military rather than the business domain is to make it easier to spot the essentials. If we can identify some principles we can then apply them in our own specific context.
		- > We may find that the farther back we look, the farther forward we can see.
	- the gaps, in war as in business, are caused by **friction**. this way of thinking is a lot like systems thinking or chaos theory, except the [[praxis]] version which is useful in the field. we can experience it directly, learn how to recognize it, and what to do.
	- **[[directed opportunism]]** will be the snappy name for this approach
- **2. The Cause**- The Three Gaps
  collapsed:: true
	- *"Friction makes doing simple things difficult and difficult things impossible"*
	- it begins with a short biography of [[Carl von Clausewitz]], the architect of the Prussian military reform of the Napoleonic era.
	- how did Clausewitz differ from theorists before him? others such as [[Dietrich Heinrich von Bülow]] believed in "scientific generalship". they felt that chance and uncertainty in war could be eliminated with planning and mathematical precision. Clausewitz instead thought that *Friktion* was an inherent part of war, that would always lead to a gap between your plans and reality. you can see him as an early precursor to [[VUCA]]
	  id:: 655a6797-d005-4ecd-9568-9a206fedd848
	- friction can come from both external and internal circumstances.
		- external friction comes from situations outside ourselves that we couldn't predict. you play at a journey, but find out the flight's delayed and your luggage is lost. that's external friction.
		- internal friction comes from the inherent unpredictability of getting an organization made up of individual humans to cooperate towards a goal. they might work at cross purposes, mis communicate, dilly-dally & cause delays, or even just plain bungle things.
		- > No engineer would dream of designing an engine without taking into account the effects of mechanical friction. If Clausewitz is right, no one should develop a strategy without taking into account the effects of organizational friction.
		- > The existence of friction is why armies need officers and businesses need managers. Anticipating and dealing with it form the core of managerial work.
	- importantly, organizations are made up of people. this means psychological factors are inherent.
	- we can group friction into three generic types:
		- **imperfect information:** uncertainties, false information, rumors
		- **imperfect transmitting and processing of information:** making judgments based on probabilities, stress caused by emotions including fear, stress caused by physical exertion, the number of people in an organization who can cause a misunderstanding or delay, differences of views especially between leaders
		- **external factors:** chance such as the weather, complexity reducing the chance of success through an accumulation of risk
	- it is in fact *impossible* to have perfect information about war, not only because of our cognitive limits as humans, but because it involves an independent agent: the enemy
	- even when information is available, it needs to be communicated and interpreted, which depends on the psychological states of the people interpreting it
	- Clausewitz, though he didn't have the language for it, realized that war was [[nonlinear]]. in that sense, he's a early precursor to [[chaos theory]]
	- war is *reciprocal*- it's an iterative process co-determined by mutual feedback
		- in a sense, an early prefiguration of [[agile]]!
	- business shares these characteristics with war. furthermore, the larger and broader the business, and the faster the pace of change, the more friction there is.
	- > Friction is a function of the *finitude of the human condition* - the fact that our *knowledge is limited* and the fact that we are *independent agents*.
	  pp.40
	- this leads us to the same Three Gaps as chapter one- the knowledge gap, the alignment gap, and the effects gap
	- these gaps in turn naturally drive us to collect more information provide more instructions and take more control (introduce more metrics). but this actively makes things worse! collecting information costs money and time, detail and clarity aren't the same thing, and controls increased rigidity
	- existing business leadership recognizes that there are gaps, but isn't great at figuring out exactly what they are. most sources only recognize one of the three gaps.
- **3. Elements of A Solution**- Directed Opportunism
  collapsed:: true
	- *"Do not command more than is necessary, or plan beyond the circumstances you can foresee"*
	- the Prussian Army at the start of the Napoleonic War was a very [[Theory X]] organization. top-down, focused on drill and compulsion. in contrast, the Napoleonic army *couldn't* build drill and discipline, so it had to become a [[Theory Y]] organization, driven by motivated commitment and improvisation. the Prussians couldn't keep up!
	- over the following decades, a General War School was set up to educate officers and build up meritocracy, and it became recognized that independence and willingness to challenge authority was what made the Prussian army effective.
		- [[Prince Friedrich Karl]] helped spread this view in the 1850s-1860s, publishing essays on the matter. "The King made you a staff officer because you should know when _not_ to obey."
	- [[Helmuth Carl Bernhard Graf von Moltke]], Chief of Staff and adviser to Prince Friedrich Karl, would finally put it all together. he argued that high autonomy among officers was desirable, and was not opposed to alignment.
		- to accomplish this, it's necessary to limit orders to the bare essentials. they should include all and only what is necessary for the subordinate officer to understand the *intention* (what we want, and why). the specifics (what to do, and how) are for the subordinate to work out!
			- ((655c4aa7-462f-47f3-af46-214b3a581069))
		- by accident, he might also be the first guy to define the role of a senior executive in a modern corporation!
	- how does this close the Three Gaps?
		- **knowledge gap:** limit direction to defining and expressing the essential intent. plan only what can be planned, and accept uncertainty.
		- **alignment gap:** allow each level to define what it would achieve to realize the intent, adding to the one above, but all united in the intention
		- **effects gap:** give individuals freedom to adjust their actions in line with the intent, make the use of individual initiative central
	- von Moltke, rather than seeing a tradeoff between alignment and [[autonomy]], felt they were independent.
		- > Von Moltke’s insight is that there is no choice to make. Far from it, he demands high autonomy and high alignment at one and the same time.
		- > The insight is that alignment needs to be achieved around intent, and autonomy should be granted around actions. Intent is expressed in terms of what to achieve and why. Autonomy concerns the actions taken in order to realize the intent; in other words, about what to do and how.
		  #alignment
	- it took some time for this approach to be accepted. there was a debate between the *Normalaktiker*, who wanted commanders to receive detailed training in "standard" tactics, and the *Auftragstaktiker*, who thought that to be impossible. instead, commanders define the *Auftrag*, and implementation is up to junior leaders. [[Auftragstaktik]] won!
		- by the 1930s, this later developed into [[Ludwig Beck]]'s [[Truppenführung]]:
		  > The basis of leadership are the mission (Auftrag) and the situation.
		- but it failed to win World War II, because operational skills cannot make up for a strategy that is at the highest level incoherent and irrational. also, because Auftragstaktik doesn't play well with tyrants- Hitler was skeptical of the very strategy that build Germany's military might, because it encouraged independence and questioning authority!
		- this later joined the canon of Western doctrine as "[[mission command]]". but not until the disaster of the Vietnam War hammered home the failures of planning:
		  > It was in any case beginning to look as if technology would allow masterplanners to control everything, with perfect information becoming instantaneously available at the center. As the brightest and the best assembled in Washington to run the Vietnam War under former Ford executive Robert McNamara, they reveled in vast amounts of data and superb communications. They measured body counts and then told the generals in Vietnam what to do next. This created a “pathology of information.”52 The business paradigms and management theory of the 1960s invaded the Pentagon and it all went horribly wrong.
		- [[Sir Nigel Bagnall]] helped push the British Army to recognize this
	- let's tie it back to business. why's this relevant?
		- it's one of the first attempts to address this kind of organizational theory, and it did it long before the business world did. [[von Bülow]]'s theories were much like [[Taylorism]], but more than a century earlier. [[Clausewitz]] and [[von Moltke]] presage modern business strategy
		- [[Auftragstaktik]] is [[scalable]]. it's not a quirky scheme cooked up by just the right team of individuals at just the right size. it scales outward to any scale, and is not one-size-fits all.
		- it was developed as a [[praxis]]! it's not just a nice theory, but literally battle-tested.
		- lastly, it's transferable. you can teach these skills. in fact, teaching is perhaps the most important part.
	- this turns strategy from a linear process into an iterative cycle:
		- > This solution constitutes a system and enacting it involves going round a loop. It involves abandoning the linear model of developing a strategic plan and then implementing it. Instead, there is a cycle of thinking and doing. The horizon within which actions are planned is limited, the effects of the actions are observed, reflected on, and new action initiated. So the thinking–doing loop becomes a learning–adapting loop.
		- in a sense, this makes [[von Moltke]] a father of [[agile]]!
	- at the core is trust:
		- > At its heart is a network of trust binding people together up, down, and across a hierarchy. Achieving and maintaining that requires constant work.
	- Bungay calls this model of [[Auftragstaktik]]/[[mission command]] as applied to business “[[directed opportunism]]”
- **4. The Knowledge Gap** - What and Why
  collapsed:: true
	- *"Strategy is a framework for decision making, a guide to thoughtful, purposive action"*
	- strategy isn't a plan, it's a decision-making framework. it sets the direction in a competitive environment by considering both the goals and the means to achieve them.
	- it's also about adapting and evolving under changing circumstances. as in war, there is always uncertainty in business. good strategy shifts the odds but doesn't guarantee success.
		- luck is more of a factor than you think!
	- strategy and execution are continual processes, that reciprocally co-determine each other
		- you need to "go round the loop" from strategy to execution and back in a repeated, systematic cycle to get it right
	- strategy is not pure rational theory or empirical analysis- it relies on insight, experience, and pattern recognition! you need to develop the insight to see the "main effort"
	- a strategy is "a what and a why"- we decide to do something now, to achieve a desired end
	- **the main effort:**
		- it's a sort of "center of gravity of the business", the core point of competition. the single thing that will have the greatest impact, or that the most other things depend on.
		- this lets us prioritize how we allocate resources, helps us keep focus at a broad level, and helps us make the right tradeoffs
	- **the strategy staircase:**
		- to strategize, what we need is really a sense of our core end goal.
		- then, considering that shared goal and our current situation, we can consider- "what constraints do we face? we risks are we up against? what the biggest thing we can do _right now_ to address them, and move generally toward that goal?" OK, that's our main effort!
		- once we complete that goal, we'll be in a new situation, with new options opened up to us, and different challenges! and we rinse and repeat. as we go, we build a stairway of strategic decisions that take us to the goal
		- it's OK that we didn't know every step of the stairway up front- what we knew is *where the staircase leads to* and *how to make the right call when we get to each new step*
		- this lets us be strategic even when we don't know what the final state will look like, or in volatile situations
- **5. The Alignment Gap** - Briefing and Backbriefing
  collapsed:: true
	- *"Tell me what you want – what you really, really want"*
	- throughout an organization, people will find themselves in situations where they need to think independently. if they haven't been provided with the info they need to make the right decision, how could they be expected to?
	- von Moltke's briefings:
		- > Orders were to be clear: logically arranged, short sentences, using universally understood expressions and railroad designations – 0700 for 7 a.m. and 1900 for 7 p.m. Orders were to be precise: subordinates were to be made acquainted with the intentions of their superior. Orders were to be complete – distinguishing the part that each unit was asked to perform. Orders were to be short. The rule was that they should never contain a single word by the omission of which their meaning would not be suddenly and completely affected.
	- a **[[strategy brief]]** is an effective way to do this. formulate a clear statement of intent, saying everything that needs to be said, and nothing extra.
	- a brief should cover not just your own level, but the higher intent from your boss and you boss's boss. this is the sweet spot to ensure enough higher context
	- a brief should cover:
		- "An account of the situation, bringing out the essential features which bear on the course of action to be taken."
		- "A short statement of the overall intent. This is classically stated as a task plus a purpose."
			- clarify the main effort!
		- "An extrapolation of the more specific tasks implied by the intent."
		- "Finally, it should give any further guidance about boundaries, in particular the constraints to be observed, and indicate future decisions which may have to be taken."
			- clarify constraints and freedoms!
	- ideally, briefing should be done in a cascade! the top level should prepare a brief. then, the level below it should prepare their own briefs about how they specifically will carry out the intent, and summarize those briefs for the level above in a **backbrief**. then, repeat for each level down, getting more specific & concrete each level
		- this gives each level a chance to check that they were heard correctly by the level below
		- this gives a chance to realign and adjust the brief in cases where it's needed
		- this process helps not only align across levels, but across functions, as it will tease out dependencies
	- this process can only work if the structure of the orgnanization reflects the task structure of the strategy! if it isn't, get the structure right *first.* make sure each task maps to an entity that can independently execute on it, with adequate resources to do so.
		- > unless the structure of the organization broadly reflects the structure of the tasks implied by executing the strategy, the strategy will not be executed.
		- > The structure has to be used to pass on the message. The message to be passed on is: “This is what we want you to achieve and why.”
			- shades of [[McLuhan]]/[[the medium is the message]]
		- you may also need to adjust the compensation structure to align incentives!
			- > Curiously, people’s convictions tend to correlate with their interests. Their interests are largely determined by the structure and the compensation system. Both, therefore, must be examined in order to identify and remove any conflicts.
			- how do we know we're doing it right?
				- > Can we identify organizational entities which can be made wholly or largely accountable for executing the key elements of the strategy to the extent that controls are in place to measure how well they are doing so?
				- > Are the leaders of these units skilled and experienced enough to direct their units on a semi-autonomous basis and are they committed to the strategy?
				- > Is there enough, but not too much, hierarchy, and does each level of the hierarchy have the decision rights it needs to play its part?
					- shades of [[The Tyranny of Structurelessness]]
	- writeups of Reuter/CEO Glocer using a method like this to overhaul the business, and von Moltke using this method in the Franco-Prussian War
	- hurdles to leap in reaching alignment:
		- > 1 What is said is not yet heard.
		  2 What is heard is not yet understood.
		  3 What is understood is not yet believed.
		  4 What is believed is not yet advocated.
		  5 What is advocated is not yet acted on.
		  6 What is acted on is not yet completed.
	- from research:
		- > Confronted with a task, and having less information available than is needed to perform that task, an organisation may react in either of two ways. One is to increase its information-processing capacity, the other to design the organisation, and indeed the task itself, in such a way as to enable it to operate on the basis of less information. These approaches are exhaustive; no others are conceivable. A failure to adopt one or the other will automatically result in a drop in the level of performance.
		- we can't infinitely scale processing capacity, so we need to take the other approach
- **6. The Effects Gap** - Independent Thinking Obedience
  collapsed:: true
	- *"Sins of omission are worse than sins of commission"*
	- some managers are unwilling to take responsibility, and pass it on up a level. others are authoritarians who will rule by decree and micromanage. both are toxic to good strategy, and we need to weed this out in recruiting & development
		- touches on [[Adorno]]'s analysis of the [[authoritarian]] temperament
	- most managers are neither of these, but that doesn't mean they're automatically good at strategy! the skills need to be built. a common development program, together with putting the skills into practice, can go a long way
		- you might think it's about hiring all the A players, but it isn't. it's about maximizing the use of the average resources you have
			- > Most organizations will by definition mainly employ average people most of the time. The real challenge is how to create an organization which enables average people to turn out above-average performance.
		- you don't *have* to train everyone! they key group is middle management, esp. the upper parts who are senior enough to make strategic decisions. it can cascade down from there.
		- culture is king- you have to have a strong sense of "the way we do things around here"
			- > At Nordstrom it is embodied in an employee handbook, which is simply a single five-by-eight-inch card stating: “Our number one goal is to provide outstanding customer service.” It then lays out what it calls the Nordstrom Rules: “Rule # 1: Use your good judgment in all situations. There will be no additional rules.”
			- > The bedrock of morale is feeling confident that you are making a contribution to a collective purpose.
		- statements, documents, training materials should _follow_ change, not lead them
	- we need to have *trust* if independent thinking obedience is to work
		- > There are two dimensions to trust. One is moral – I will trust you if I am confident in your motives. [...] The other is practical – I will trust you if I believe you are competent.
		- the briefing process lets us set the boundaries and the control loop according to how much trust we have.
	- people often aren't doing what they need to do to execute on the company strategy. however, they're typically acting rationally _from their own standpoint_. so, analyze the subsystem of the organization that they're part of! if we understand the goals, resources, and constraints that this subsystem operates with, we can understand it. then we can change those things in order to change the result.
		- shades of [[Thinking in Systems]]
	- **budgeting** and **performance management** are both important parts of everyday practice. how people act will be shaped by them. *so they'd better be lined up with your company strategy*- otherwise, folks will be pulled in different directions!
		- making them flexible and lightweight is better than heavy and thorough.
		- tying them into the strategy process via cascading is good!
		- try for a system where they happen on a faster cadence (quarterly rather than annually), adjustment is encouraged, and budgets are rolling forecasts rather than targets.
	- we need to have metrics if we want to know whether we were successful in achieving our intent. but we need to take care not to succumb to [[Goodhart's Law]]!
		- > replacing direction setting with control would be like asking a compass to tell us our destination, rather than using it to help us get there.
		- scorecards should only be used in strategy to monitor the effects of your actions, not as a replacement for strategy. they can tell you "how am I doing?" but not "what ought I do?"
		- "command" and "control" are different things
		- the scorecard needs to be supplemented by going out and seeing how things are on the ground!
- **7. Leadership That Works** - From Common Sense to Common Practice
	- *"The director is detached, calculating, and flexible; the manager is engaged, realistic, and pragmatic; the leader is committed, passionate, and determined"*
	- **strategy** vs **tactics** is not enough- von Moltke knew there's a lot of stuff that doesn't fall into either bucket. so, he added a mid-level, **operations**
		- > This was the realm of free thinking that translated strategy into action, requiring strategic thinking and operational direction on the part of the entire officer corps.
		- > Strategy is unitary and binding, and tactics are standardized and binding. So unless we create a third level, we have tied everybody’s hands. Unless we place limits around that level, we invite chaos into the organization instead of keeping it outside, where it belongs.
	- In this view, Taylor wasn't _wrong_ per se- he just took the realm of tactics, and tried to apply it to all business!
	- [[The Executive's Trinity]]
		- military officer literature is all about command and leadership. business literature was all about management, is now all about leadership. we need all three of these things. but "command" has a funny reputation- so let's say "directing"
	- summary of the book in 10 GBOs (Glimpses of the Blindingly Obvious)
	  >1. We are finite beings with limited knowledge and independent wills.
	  2. The business environment is unpredictable and uncertain, so we should expect the unexpected and should not plan beyond the circumstances we can foresee.
	  3. Within the constraints of our limited knowledge we should strive to identify the essentials of a situation and make choices about what it is most important to achieve.
	  4. To allow people to take effective action, we must make sure they understand what they are to achieve and why.
	  5. They should then explain what they are going to do as a result, define the implied tasks, and check back with us.
