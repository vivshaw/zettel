- quite common in [[Eastern Christianity]]
- some examples:
	- > Just as the senses can neither grasp nor perceive the things of the mind, just as
	  representation and shape cannot take in the simple and the shapeless, just as corporal form
	  cannot lay hold of the intangible and incorporeal, by the same standard of truth beings are
	  surpassed by the infinity beyond being, intelligences by that oneness which is beyond
	  intelligence. Indeed, the inscrutable One [i.e., God] is out of the reach of every rational
	  process. Nor can any words come up to the inexpressible Good, this One, this Source of all
	  unity, this supra-existent Being. Mind beyond mind, word beyond speech, it is gathered up
	  by no discourse, by no intuition, by no name. It is and it is as no other being is. Cause [i.e.,
	  ground] of all existence, and therefore itself transcending existence, it alone could give an
	  authoritative account of what it really is.
	  *([[Pseudo-Dionysius]], 1987, originally, c.5th-6th century pp.49-50)*
	- > For to have any idea of what God might be is impossible and completely beyond the reach
	  of all creation, whether visible or invisible. Moreover, ‘from those things that are around’
	  the essence, we learn only that God exists, and when these things are contemplated
	  properly and piously, God yields Himself up to those who gaze upon Him. But all the
	  things that are ‘around’ the essence do not disclose what the essence itself is, but what it is
	  not, such as not being created, not having a beginning, not being finite, not being
	  corporeal, and any other such things that are around the essence, and indicate what it is not
	  but not what it is … Thus, the negative statements indicate not that the Divine is
	  something, but rather what it is not, and these are in compliance with the affirmations
	  around that something (which the Divine is not).
	  *([[Maximus the Confessor]], 2014, originally, c.630 pp.65-67)*
	- > Thus, it is clear that God exists, but what He is in essence and nature is unknown and
	  beyond all understanding. That He is without a body is obvious, for how could a body
	  contain that which is limitless, boundless, formless, impalpable, invisible, simple, and
	  uncompounded?
	  *([[John of Damascus]], 1958, originally, c.743 p.170)*
	- > One who would declare the essence of something must explain what it is, but not what it is
	  not. However, as regards what God is, it is impossible to say what He is in His essence, so
	  it is better to discuss Him by abstraction from all things whatever. For He does not belong
	  to the number of beings, not because He does not exist, but because He transcends all
	  beings and being itself. And, if knowledge respects beings, then that which transcends
	  knowledge will certainly transcend essence, and, conversely, what transcends essence will
	  transcend knowledge.
	  *(Ibid., pp.171-172)*
