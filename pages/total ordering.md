- **total ordering** is a relation $<=$ among the elements in a set $S$ with these properties:
	- It is **[[reflexive]]:** $a <= a$ for all elements in $S$.
	- It is **[[transitive]]:** if $a <= b$ and $b <= c$ then $a <= c$
	- It is **anti-symmetric:** if $a <= b$ and $b <= a$ then $a = b$
	- It is **total:** for any two elements $a, b$, either $a <= b$ or $b <= a$
