- the use of statistical technqiues to assess and validate [[measurement]] processes
- in terms of **resolution**, we hope that it's at least as fine as 1/10 the [[natural tolerance]]
- we might assess:
	- **[[repeatability]]** - when we measure again, does it line up?
	- **[[reproducibility]]** - do our measurement line up with other systems' measurements?
- we might conduct:
	- a **potential study**, only assessing capability
	- a **short-term study**, assessing both capability and control. this takes more repeated measurements (ballpark 4 to 8 rounds)
	- a **long-term study** (ballpark 25 rounds)
- we assume:
	- measurement error is independent
	- normally distributed
	- and independent of the true value (we can check this via correlation between the mean and standard deviation)
