- the doctrine of "non-self"- that no unchanging, permanent self or essence can be found in any phenomenon
	- not necessarily the same as believing there is no ego, or that you're not real! can be that the ego isn't "*really* real"- of course it exists, but the ego is born out of fear and isolation, as a contingent way of organizing the phenomena we experience
- justified with the *argument from impermanence*:
	- if there was a self, it would be permanent
	- none of the five skandhas (psychophysical elements) are permanent
	- therefore, there is no self
