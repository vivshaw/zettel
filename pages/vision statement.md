- a particular striking one, used at Summa Healthcare:
	- > You are what people see when they arrive here.
	  Yours are the eyes they look into when they are frightened and lonely.
	  Yours are the voices people hear when they ride the elevators and when they try to sleep
	  and when they try to forget their problems.
	  You are what they hear on their way to appointments that could affect their destinies
	  and what they hear after they leave those appointments.
	  Yours are the comments people hear when you think they can’t.
	  Yours is the intelligence and caring that people hope they’ll find here.
	  If you’re noisy, so is the hospital.
	  If you’re rude, so is the hospital.
	  And if you are wonderful – so is the hospital.
	  No visitors, no patients can ever know the real you, the you that you know is there –
	  unless you let them see it.
	  All they can know is what they see and hear and experience.
	  And so I have a stake in your attitude and in the collective attitudes of everyone who works
	  at this medical center.
	  We are judged by your performance.
	  It is judged by the care you give, the attention you pay and the courtesies you extend.
	  Thank you for all you are doing.
