- it feels relatively important to have these run by an engineer. I want to have buy-in that it is acatually worthwhile, because otherwise, participation will be cursory and results useless. one of the best ways to make people feel it is worthwhile is when they actually get to shape it to _be_ worthwhile to them!
- one framework worth trying: "rose" (success), "bud" (new ideas or stuff you wanna know more about), "thorns" (challenges or places you need more support)
