- the ability of a system to stretch and adjust to handle surprises
- if your system can't stretch and adjust, it is brittle! it may operate great in "normal" situations, but will collapse rapidly when outside the expected situation
- we can't determine the boundary of a system's extensibility up-front- [[incident]]s show it to us.
- this is related to [[Safety-I and Safety-II]]- we think of "ability to flexibly respond" as a positive capability we wish to cultivate
