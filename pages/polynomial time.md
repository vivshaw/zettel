- a class of problems that can be decided in $O(n^k)$ [[time complexity]] for some constant $k$
- some nice properties:
	- polynomials are closed under addition, multiplication, and composition. that means if we compose polynomial-time algorithms in this way, the result will still be polynomial
	- things that are doable in polynomial time on one architecture are generally polynomial time on all common architectures- Turing machines, actual modern CPUs, parallel proces sing clusters
