- from [a study on why doctors won't adopt smartphone apps, and prefer pagers](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1197955913), and I learned it [via Fred Hebert](https://ferd.ca/notes/rhip-doctors-and-pagers.html)
	- **Risk**: Doctors often felt cell phones didn't have enough battery to go through a full shift; Pagers had fewer dead zones than cell phones; During big emergencies, the pager network has less of a tendency to be overloaded than the phone network
	- **Habit**: They were used to pagers, knew how to use it, and the new software was more of a pain.
	- **Identity**: Pagers feel like a "symbol of doctorness"â€”a patient seeing a doctor look at their pager knows it's work related in a way they don't know it is when they appear to be texting someone else during a consult. This can end up changing how they feel about their own job as well.
	- **Power**: This was the biggest, most disruptive one. Phones inverted the power dynamics, and this requires expanding a bit.
