- I want a bicolor look, vert and or.
	- vert represents growth, life, and the natural world
	- or represents prosperity
	- Green & Gold are the colors of my alma mater
	- there's a minor canting aspect- "Vivian" coming from the Latin "Vivianus", coming from "Vivus"- "alive"
	- most importantly... I think these look really nice together
- For visual elements, I want trees and a wolf
	- I want to conjure up the image of a wolf living at the edge of a forest. these are canting arms- "Shaw" is my surname. the British "Shaw" comes from the old english "sceaga", "dweller by the wood". the Scottish "Shaw" comes from "Sitheach", "wolf".
