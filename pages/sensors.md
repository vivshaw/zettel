- sensors can be:
	- **active** sensors, which emit a signal and measure how the environment reacts
	- **passive** sensors, which measure signals from the environment.
- we may care about a sensor's:
	- **range** - how far can we sense from?
	- **dynamic range** - what's the difference between the minimum and maximum measurement?
	- **resolution** - what's the smallest increment we can measure?
	- [[accuracy]], calculated as $accuracy = 1 - \dfrac{\lvert m - v \rvert}{v}$, where $m$ is the sensor output and $v$ is the true value
	- [[precision]]
	- **bandwidth** - how rapidly does it take measurements?
- we also need to consider [[proprioception]] vs [[exteroception]]
