- student of [[Thales of Miletus]]
	- carried on the theory of the *[[arche]]*, but he instead held that the *arche* was the *[[apeiron]]*, the boundless. which was infinite in size, had no origin, and had no definite nature
- also performed astronomy and mapmaking!
	- held that the earth was surrounded by a primal fire, and the heavenly bodies were holes through which we could see the fire. their formation and movements were through the natural interactions of opposed forces, like hot and cold
	- thought that things were wetter in the distant past, but that heat was gradually drying the world and shrinking the waters. like an ancient version of global warming!
	- thought that the earth was a cylinder, like a drum, existing at the exact center of the cosmos. it did not move because there was no *reason* to move out from the center in any particular direction
		- that's basically the [[principle of sufficient reason]] in an early form!!
