- for any real number $x$ and integer $n$, $(\cos x+i\sin x{\big )}^{n}=\cos nx+i\sin nx$
	- this connects the complex numbers with trigonometry. suppose we want to raise a complex number to a power $n$. put it in polar form, like $r (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)$. then by the theorem above, you get $r^n (\cos (n \theta) + i \sin (n \theta))$.
	- or in plain English, instead of doing complex algebra, you can simply raise the _length_ to the power, then multiply the _angle_.
	- another fun consequence is that is a complex number is on the unit circle (so $r = 1$), multiplying it by itself simply makes it spin around the circle!
