- what is a crisis? there are competing definitions, one based on events, the other on perceptions
	- > An (organizational) crisis is a low-probability, high-impact event that threatens the viability of the organization and is characterized by ambiguity of cause, effect, and means of resolution, as well as by a belief that decisions must be made swiftly.
	  — Pearson & Clair, 1998
	- > A crisis is the perception or an unpredictable event that threatens important expectancies of stakeholders and can seriously impact an organization's performance and generate negative outcomes.
	  — Coombs, 2007
- a crisis can be a learning opportunity. both a danger, and an opportunity for change, simultaneously
- forces that can lead to crisis:
	- external:
		- political forces: governments and their policies and leaders, agency decisions, laws and regulations
		- economic forces: broader market trends of expansion and contraction, inflation, the interest rate, exchange rates, commodity prices, supply chain disruption
		- social forces: public trust, social values, traditions, trends
		- technological forces: innovation, disruption, creativity, conversely resistance to technology
		- ecological forces: pollution, climate change, resource depletion
- crisis ties into the [[life cycle of a firm]]!
