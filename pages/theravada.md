- Theravada Buddhism is focused on the teachings and scriptures of [[the Buddha]], as collected in the [[Pali Canon]].
- Theravada is focused on the foundational dharma teachings, and the path of the [[arhat]].
- metaphorically, we can say Theravadins see negative emotions like a toxic plant. when we keep eating the plant, we poison ourselves. the way out is to stop eating the poison.
