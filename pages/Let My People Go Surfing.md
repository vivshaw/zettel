- **Introduction**
  collapsed:: true
	- the book is about a central contradiction, between business's role in destroying the natural environment, native cultures, and equality on the one hand, with its generative capacity to make food, employ people, cure disease, and other good things on the other. can business do the good stuff without losing our souls in the process?
	- it's also about a climbing hippie stumbling his way into business success, despite his disdain for the establishment and money-making
	- and it's also about the rise of Patagonia as a new kind of business- one that takes [[ESG]] responsibility seriously, doesn't chase unchecked growth, and flouts conventional business wisdom to do the right thing
- **Ch. 1 - History**
  collapsed:: true
	- starts with a biography of Yvon
	- he was the child of a Quebecois farmer, and dreamed of being a fur trapper growing up
	- family moved to California for health reasons
	- Yvon was an outcast at school due to language and cultural differences, so spent his time off by himself in nature, often fishing
	- > I learned at an early age that it's better to invent your own game; then you can always be a winner. I found my games in the ocean, creeks, and hillsides surrounding Los Angeles.
	- got into falconry together with a gaggle of other weirdos, forming the Southern California Falconry Club, and helping to enact the first falconry regulations in CA
	- both picked up a love of climbing while searching for falcon aeries, and had his first near-death experience almost falling off a cliff from a rope malfunction
	- after school, went out to Yosemite with Sierra Club climbers, and picked up blacksmithing to make his own climbing gear, starting with climbing pitons and carabiners
		- most gear was European, but Euro and American climbers had different philosophies:
		- > We American climbers were brought up reading the transcendental writers like [[Emerson]], [[Thoreau]], and [[John Muir]]. You climb the mountains or visit the wilderness but leave no trace of having been there.
	- lived off the land and the climbing equipment sales, while camping out illegally in national parks.
		- > We took special pride in the fact that climbing rocks and icefalls had no economic value in society. We were rebels from the consumer culture.
		- > It's not the goal of grand alpinism to face peril, but it is one of the tesets one must undergo to deserve the joy of rising for an instant above the state of crawling grubs.
		  Lionel Terrary, *Conquistadors of the Useless*
	- got called up for the draft in Korea, but shirked duties and spent time AWOL climbing with Korean buddies
	- after the war, came straight back to Yosemite, summited the North American Wall on El Capitan, then started "hiring" his first "employees"
	- kept a focus on great quality because "they were their own best customers", they were [[dogfooding]] their product, and might die if they didn't keep quality up!
	- fun [[Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry]] quote re: aviation
		- > In anything at all, perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything left to take away, when a body has been stripped down to its nakedness.
	- studying [[Zen]] led Yvon to prefer simplicity too, as did [[free solo]] climbing
		- treated smithing with the seriousness and grace of Zen archery, mastering each movement until fluid and effortless. similar to [[Mastery (book)]]!
	- everyone took turns going off on lengthy climbing trips, and paid themselves hourly for the time they spent minding the shop while not off climbing. the business was just a means to an end
	- by 1970, was the US's leading supplier of climbing gear! but they started to become "environmental villains"- their pitons were damaging rock faces across America
		- pivoted to [[clean climbing]]- introduced the Stopper and Hexcentric, which were nondamaging. even though this cannibalized their core market in pitons, they were able to launch a revolution in climbing culture and make it a success
	- branches out into clothing as Yvon had personal desires for better climbing clothes, that caught on- like durable corduroy or canvas-duck pants custom-built for purpose, imported rugby shirts better than standard US men's shirts
		- by 1974 opened first contract with a clothes supplier, which was a disaster- quality was terrible, shipments were late... turned out supply chain for clothing was a totally different problem from hard goods!
	- brought on a new general manager in 1979, who made it her job to translate Yvon's visions into reality, and to start from square 1 and learn how to run it from scratch
	- > If you want to understand the entrepreneur, study the juvenile delinquent. The delinquent is saying with his actions, "This sucks. I'm going to do my own thing."
	- 80 percenter anecdote
	- experimented with new fabrics to solve outdoor clothing needs- synthetic pile sweaters rather than natural layers, so they wouldn't soak and freeze (first made form material intended for toilet seat covers!), and synthetic long johns (made from polypropylene like marine rope or diaper linings).
	- taught the base/insulator/shell layering concept which is so prevalent nowadays
	- fabrics were developed collaboratively with Malden Mills, coming out of bankruptcy after fake fur coat market crashed. close involvement with a company with more capital and resources were critical to the new products! but shortcomings with the fabric led to significant investment in internal R&D capacity
		- once again made a huge shift to polyester, cannibalizing their own bunting and polypropylene sales- but scoring a hit, and staying one step ahead of competition. had to trust in the power of the product- knowing what they wanted and having a vision of the next level.
	- after a restructure and new office in 1984, brought in open-plan offices and at-work childcare. things that were weird at the time, but a matter of practicality for Patagonia, and nowadays have caught on
		- some of the folks involved were later part of the federal push for parental leave
	- Yvon became more concerned about environmental causes after seeing beloved destinations deteriorate. began putting Patagonia money toward restoration of the Ventura River- and it worked! so, pledged 1% of sales or 10% of pretax profits to enviro causes, ranging from river restoration to GMOs to automotive pollution
		- also got involved in anti-globalization activism against [[NAFTA]] and [[GATT]]
	- didn't just agitate for the environment externally, started reducing Patagonia's own environmental footprint, with adoption of recycled materials for magazines and clothes
	- Yvon doesn't use computers!
	- in the late 80s, pace of innovation slowed, and international expansion was a struggle. litigation also grew, with multiple lawsuits against Chouinard Equipment. this led to Chapter 11 bankruptcy, an employee buyout, and a rebrand as Black Diamond
	- tried to up the tempo in the early 90s by splitting into 8 product lines, appointing product czars to lead 'em, and building and hiring out to support massive growth. it didn't land. the org structure was too complex, there wasn't enough training for new leaders, they didn't have the processes to work together toward the right goals
	- in 91, it came to a head. growth was only 20%, rather than the 40% they planned for. the bottom fell out of the economy. their primary band had money problems and reduced credit. and they had to do a 20% layoff to survive. Yvon sees this as the darkest day in the company's history.
	- put together a board of directors of trusted advisors, including environmentalists like [[Jerry Mander]]. adopted a new set of corporate values, recognizing that we're living in a world where survivability, quality of human life, and decline in the health of the natural world are paramount and that the economic and corporate values we lived by were hurting us. so instead, they needed to adopt an ecology of new values, in which profit was secondary, and unchecked growth an explicit non-goal.
		- realized he was trying to create, in business, values he had learned as an individual sportsman. risk sports / can't "have it all" anecdote
		- this finally led him to realize why he was in business. it was to create a new model of business that others could learn from, one that would let them be successful without killing the planet
		- > Make the best product, cause no unnecessary harm, and use business to inspire and implement solutions to the environmental crisis.
- **Ch. 2 - Philosophies**
	- this chapter outlines the philosophies Patagonia follows, which are guidelines more than rules, and are communicated to everybody. they are only a rough map, but in the rapidly changing world of business, a rough map is the only kind that's useful!
	- ## product design philosophy
	  collapsed:: true
		- "make the best product" is key- Patagonia is a product-driven company, so they're nothing without high quality products. second-best isn't good enough!
		- but what does it mean to be the best? is a Patagonia shirt better than a handwoven Italian haute couture shirt?
			- it is, _for its purpose_! you can't pop that Italian shirt in the wash & dry, or wear it through dirty, rugged wilderness for 3 weeks, or take it up a strenuous rock climb. so that's the goal- make the _best in class_
		- for quality to be an effective goal, _it has to be objective_, not just taste
			- [[checklists]] are a good tool for this!
		- Patagonia's quality standard:
			- **is it functional?** the function should determine the design and materials. this is the _opposite_ of how much of the fashion industry works, where form is foremost. and the function must be something someone actually needs!
			- **is it multifunctional?** why buy two pieces of gear when one will do the trick? this derives from the mountain climbing tradition of carrying as little as possible. it also ties in to environmental responsibility- every extra piece of gear is more emissions, more waste... so do as much as possible, so as little as possible is necssary.
				- also references [[John Muir]]'s habit of taking only a tin cup, a loaf of bread, and an overcoat
				- and [[Thoreau]]'s advice: "I say beware of all enterprises that require new clothes..."
			- **is it durable?** the overall durability of a product is only as good as its weakest element. so the goal is a product whose parts a) last a long time, and b) wear out at about the same rate.
				- this is the opposite of the electronics world's [[planned obsolescence]], or the disposability of fast fashion
				- shades of the [[Vimes Boots Theory]], haha
			- **is it repairable?** no matter how durable, clothing will eventually wear through. when it does, how easy is it to mend? can a zipper be repaired without taking apart the whole jacket? Patagonia offers repair services, and sources DIY repair guides, _and_ offers recycling for the un-repairable stuff.
				- "repair is a radical act"
				- shades of [[right to repair]]
			- **does it fit our customer?** small/medium/large is not enough, people have different builds, and the type of person and thus build may even differ from activity to activity! fit should also be consistent so folks know what they're getting. and, functional clothes may be worn in layers- will they fit in that case?
			- **is it as simple as possible?** [[complexity]] often means that the functional needs weren't solved!
				- from Dieter Rams, "good design is as little design as possible"
			- **is the product line simple?** too many choices lead to choice paralysis, especially when it's important to make an intelligent decision.
				- from the Dalai Lama, too much choice brings unhappiness
				- each new Patagonia product requires, on average, hiring 2.5 new employees
			- **is it an innovation or an invention?** it's easier to succeed by having a product so unique and excellent that it has no competition, than to compete on fundamentals like price, distribution, and promotion
				- inventions are hard! most successful inventors only have a few marketable inventions in a lifetime. so, focus on innovations.
				- it's [[remix]] culture! treat the original as inspiration, but do your own thing with it. or like [[fusion cuisine]]!
			- **is it a global design?** think of not just an American business operating globally, but a business that tailors its products specifically to local markets around the globe.
			- **is it easy to care for and clean?** cleaning turns out to be one of the biggest environmental villains in the lcothing industry, causing up to 4x as much harm as the manufacture process! plus, finicky cleaning is a chore.
			- **does it have added value?** only 10% to 15% of American household budgets go towards raw essentials. the rest is upgrades. so, is your product a real upgrade?
				- great customer service is part of this
			- **is it authentic?** the product needs to deliver exactly what consumers need out of that type of product. rugby shirts should actually be suitable for rugby.
			- **is it beautiful?** #fashion
				- products should look good! but- chase art, not fashion.
				- > Fashion is happening only now, and art is timeless. In fact, fashion is always passÃ© because it is a response to an event in the past. It may recycle someday, but it will certainly be dead tomorrow.
				- > When I'm working on a problem, I never think about beauty. I think only about how to solve the problem. But when I have finished, if the solution is not beautiful, I know it is wrong.
				  â [[Buckminster Fuller]]
			- **are we just chasing fashon?** Patagonia is too slow to get in on trends. product dev lifecycle is generally 18 months, fabrics are not off-the-shelf and existing prints are not used. trying to chase fashion just makes Patagonia less effective, so why try?
			- **are we designing for our core customer?** not all customers are equal! Patagonia's core customers are the pros out in the field, who define the state of the art. these people often have trouble even affording the clothing- thus the Pro Purchase Program to get preferred rates. benefits to other customers are a side gig.
			- **does it cause any unnecessary harm?** the way to do the least harm, is to know exactly what you are doing, every step of the way. otherwise, you will slip into doing business just like everybody else.
				- **use organic cotton.** cotton farming uses highly toxic pesticides, and leaves the earth barren for years. switching to organic cotton was a huge undertaking that involved going directly to the few farmers that did it and the mills to convince them to process it. but it worked.
					- this involved a transitional phase, of cotton made with organic practices, but not yet certified
					- it also involved phases of clothing being made with organic fabric, but synthetic dyes and treatment. moving those to be organic took even longer!
				- **use other fibers according to harm.** cotton requires more resources than linen or hemp. you'd think wool would be less harmful, but just meeting the output of one Orlon mill would require devoting much of the eastern US to sheep agriculture! so, use synthetic fibers, but ones that are recyclable. and when using wool, try to limit the harms of grazing in fragile environs.
				- **dyes and synthetics.** doesn't make much sense to take all the toxicity and damage out of the production process, only to put it back in. this required a level of care in choosing dyes that most businesses would not consider, as well as phasing out popular materials like PVC, and inventing new materials like a neoprene substitute.
	- ## production philosophy
	  collapsed:: true
		- starts with the example of hand-knit sweaters for Irish fishermen. Patagonia can create a lot _more_ sweaters than a hand knitter. but at maintaining quality, Patagonia has a _disadvantage_! she has a single set of eyes and hands, and she knows her level of skill. Patagonia has a large number of industrial facilities and many employees and suppliers.
		- the challenge, then, is how to re-create that devotion to quality that a hand-craftsman has, on the industrial scale. #quality #craftsmanship
		- some principles, then, to keep in mind:
			- **business is a race.** being first matters. chasing trends won't get you there. inventing or discovering new things is just about the strongest advantage you can have.
				- but it's hard to maintain a sense of urgency within a business. even moreso with outside suppliers!
				- > The entrepreneurial way is to immediately take a forward step and if that feels good, take another, if not, step back. Learn be doing, it is a faster process.
			- **involve the designer with the producer.** building things proceeds more smoothly when the folks designing it collaborate with the folks building it. otherwise, you'll submit impossible designs and trip over avoidable problems in practice.
				- concurrent, not asssembly-line production
				- this doesn't just mean up-front collab- it's ongoing! will everyone in the process follow through according to plan, or will they deviate?
			- **develop long-term relationships with suppliers and contractors.** Patagonia, rather than working with many suppliers and chasing the lowest cost, develops deep relationships with a small number of supplier that they know can meet the quality bar. the supply chain needs to be a "functioning, interconnected system".
				- this has a risk! it ties your success to those suppliers! hopefully, the result is one of mutually linked success, not of being dragged down
				- Patagonia also puts a lot of effort into vetting suppliers, and into how Patagonia contacts rep the Patagonia philosophy and image to them
				- nowadays, this has expanded into helping train the suppliers to meet Patagonia's bar. you can't always expect everyone to already meet your standards.
			- **weigh quality first, against on-time delivery and low cost.** ideally, you need to be pursuing all three goals as complementary. but when push comes to shove, sometimes you have to put one first. if your goal is to create the best possible product, quality needs to be the one you put first. (but you still can't give up on the others!) #quality
			- **go for it, but do your homework.** success is not just about taking risks- it's about taking the right risks, in an informed way. do your research, and test your ideas.
				- there are many types of test- quick-and-dirty test of a new idea, "living with the product", testing prod samples, test marketing...
				- > Like the Zen approach to archery or anything else, you identify the goal and then forget about it and concentrate on the process.
			- **measure twice, cut once.** if a customer discovers a mistake, you lose their trust. better to discover it in QC. even _better_ to discover it on the production line. or even in advance!
				- I think this ties into [[shifting left]], and/or to [[lean manufacturing]]!
			- **fair trade certification.** [[Fair Trade]] certified items have a community development premium added, that goes to the worker coops that produced the product. by participating in this Patagonia reinvests in the folks that they rely on.
			- **borrow ideas from other disciplines.** the world is constantly changing, and you need to be practicing [[continuous improvement]] to keep up. borrow ideas from anywhere, even places that seem quite different!
				- the drive for quality also doesn't end at the product- it has to extend into building quality into the ways we work, how we organize ourselves, how we learn...
	- ## distribution philosophy
	  collapsed:: true
		- a company that is not diversified in its product and operations is as risky as a farm practicing monoculture! #ecology
		- Patagonia pursues many channels- self-owned retail stores, wholesale, mail order, e-commerce... and does this across many countries. this provides balance- when one country's in a recession, others might not. when one channel's doing poorly, another might improve.
		- each channel requires its own unique expertise! you can't just tack 'em on- you need to understand what makes that method of distribution tick.
		- retail and wholesale allow folks to connect in-person and build community, in a way other channels can't. this is important to forming the next generation of sportsmen.
		- channels in more detail:
			- **mail order.** they've been in it since the 1950s!
				- they treat the catalog as their "soapbox"- an opportunity to sell not jsut the product, but themselves & their philosophy. e.g., educating folks on layering systems, or environmental issues. the primary purpose is to communicate with the customer. that communication doesn't need to be in the form of purchasing goods.
				- for this channel, it's especially important not to be out of stock. if someone just receives a catalog and the item they want is already gone, why would they order again?
				- but you can't target 100% fulfillment rate. the amount of inventory you need to hold is nonlinear- e.g., you might need to double it just to get from 95% to 98%. so Patagonia targets 93-95%
				- for mail-order, "on-time delivery" means "when the customer wants it"
				- the model for customer services is the old-school hardware store owner, who spends time with each customer to find the specific widget for the job, no matter how long it takes.
				- regaining trust is far more expensive than not losing it in the first place. but when you do lose it, you really should go that extra mile to regain it.
				- break the rules that don't apply to you! Patagonia doesn't do square-inch analysis, focus groups, write vanity or greed focused copy...
				- they've actually seen _decreases_ in sales when they gave more space to product!
			- **ecommerce.** runs similarly to mail order, except that it can react much more quickly!
				- can be a mass communication channel, or very targeted! e.g., email campaigns for jackets targeted specifically at places with cold forecasts.
				- ecom is active, not passive! a customer can't just passively flip through it. you need to actively get 'em to click.
				- ecom has now eclipsed mail order for Patagonia!
			- **retail.**
				- started out because in the 60s and 70s, the outdoor goods market was not that great for clothing! no dealers carried much Patagonia stuff, it was all mixed together and presented poorly, and hard goods were the real focus
				- instead of buying expensive real estate in a prime location, bought an old auto garage and renovated it into a destination store. Patagonia continued with this approach, insisting on buildings that respected local culture and history, and that could last for another 100 years.
				- opening stores in cities didn't cut into wholesaler sales! in fact, they went up.
				- turning over inventory faster is more profitable than high margins!
			- **wholesale.**
				- requires a much smaller investment to get the product into customers' hands
				- the way to get Patagonia's philosophy across, is to actually pursue close relationships with the wholesalers. this is much harder and more time-consuming than just dealin' with everybody and axing the contracts that don't work out. but it gets a better, less-risky result.w
				- works to have 20-25% of the wholesaler's business and/or to be it's first or second largest partner. this aligns incentives- a dealer is likely to go along with someone that supplies 25% of their revenue.
				- specialty outdoor stores tend to be a hodgepodge of stuff. they have a bit of everything, but it's hard to find any particular thing in depth. so the customer can't find what they actually need to go and do their outdoor activity! Patagonia wants to avoid this.
				- Patagonia doesn't sell to department stores or massive sport chains. so, its wholesale dealers have shrunk since the 80s.
		- interesting aside on entering the Japanese market- the traditional wisdom is, for a foreign company to enter Japan, they'll need local partners. this is because the system of distribution is very complex, involving networks of trading companies, banks, and jobbers. Patagonia _tried_ doing it that way, but it didn't work! so Patagonia ignored the usual guidance, and decided to enter as a wholly-owned operation, doing things California style. and it worked! Chouinard's suggestion is that companies traditionally fail _because_ they follow the received wisdom about Japan. what's wrong is _actually_ that their quality wasn't up to Japanese standards. #Japan #business
		- another aside on environmental costs of transportation- a Patagonia shirt requires about 110,000 BTUs to manufacture. but shipping it across the US costs another 50,000 BTUs. almost 50% of the environmental cost in the shipping! that's hard to solve. Chouinard's suggestions for a healthier way of distributing: #environmentalism
			- produce locally whenever possible.
			- discourage airfreight specifically. the environmental costs are much higher than the small benefits of getting something early.
			- the globalized economy simply isn't sustainable. there's no method that doesn't depend on burning huge amounts of fossil fuel.
		- a digression on Patagonia's philosophy of architecure: #architecture #philosophy
			- **don't build a new building unless it's absolute necessary.** choose a building that's already there. renovate if needed!
			- **try to save old or historic buildings from being torn down.** remove fake "improvements" by former tenants, and restore buildings to be "a gift to the neighobrhood"
			- **if you can't be retro, build quality.** "the esthetic life expectancy of the building should be as long as the physical material's life span"
			- **use recycled, and recyclable, materials.**
			- **anything that is built should be repairable and easily maintained.**
			- **buildings should be constructed to last as long as possible.**
			- **each store must be unique.**
	- ## marketing philosophy
	  collapsed:: true
		- we all spend our lives cultivating a public image, whether we realize or not. so do companies!
		- that public image can sometimes be very different from who the company really is. Patagonia takes a different tack- just tell the customer who we really are. fiction is more difficult than nonfiction! it's harder to lie your way into customer trust than to go earn it and say so.
		- things at the heart of Patagonia's image: hard-core outdoor authenticity, use by the folks that make it, wildness, environmentalism, humanity
		- > Patagonia's image is a human voice. It expresses the joy of people who love the world, who are passionate about their beliefs, and who want to influence the future. It is not processed; it won't compromise its humanity. This means that it will offend, and it will inspire.
		- how Patagonia tackles this:
			- **telling the entire story.** Patagonia "makes products for a deeper, less distracted experience of the world and its wild places". so its image has to do the same!
				- the catalog is the foundation, because it can tell a story, can command attention, encourages reading and focus... the rest of the advertising is built from the foundation the catalog establishes
				- the catalog's primary goal is "to share and encourage a particular philosophy of life". product sales grow out of that, not vice versa.
			- **photography.** "honesty is what we strive for in our marketing and photography".
				- Patagonia doesn't use models- instead, uses real sportsmen in real situations, and otherwise photos of the clothes without people in 'em. the photos are customer-submitted and carefully chosen to pick what matches the philosophy.
			- **copy.**
				- two basic kinds of copy: personal stories that illustrate a value or promotes a cause, and descriptive copy to sell product. so, not just ad copy- stuff like the Clean Climbing essay, field reports, environmental causes.
				- write as though you are the customer, and [[golden rule]] it!
				- as sales have moved away from mail order and toward retail and ecom, new channels are needed for this copy. so Patagonia started a books imprint, started making films, and embraced social media.
			- **promotion.** "Our promotional efforts begin with the product."
				- it's easiest to promote products that are game-changers or best in class. if you have no competition, where else will folks go?
				- 3 principles:
					- inspire and educate, rather than promote
					- prefer to earn credibility, rather than buy it
					- advertise only as a last resort, and only in sport-focused magazines
				- people most value advice from a trusted friend, after that, from a recognized expert.... only distant last an advertiser
				- provide gear (and even money!) to top sportsmen. if they like what you provide, they'll become ambassadors and trusted experts, and advise you on how to make your product betters
				- seek positive coverage through 3rd-party press. but do it by actually having things to say. accomplish things that matter, then sell the story.
	- ## financial philosophy
	  collapsed:: true
		- businesses are not ultimately responsible to their customers, shareholders, employees... they're responsible to their resource base. without a healthy environment, there _is_ no business
		- Patagonia is product-driven. the product comes first. this is different than distribution companies... or worse, companies that exist just to be sold!
		- Patagonia's mission statement, surprisingly, says nothing about turning a profit! in fact, they consider the _real_ bottom line to be the amount of good they have done.
		- but... you still have to be profitable is you want to accomplish good, _as a business_. so Patagonia assumed the responsibility of leadership, trying to show corporate America by example how to be better.
		- > It's okay to be eccentric, as long as you're rich; otherwise you're just crazy.
		- customers expect quality now. you need to treat finance as just one factor among many important ones- product quality, corporate responsibility, sustainability...
		- Patagonia is privately owned and does not plan to go public, it does not plan to expand outside its market, it does not want to be financially leveraged. it grows at a natural rate, even if that rate is slower
		- > We never wanted to be a big company. We wanted to be the best company, and it's easier to try to be the best small company than the best big company.
		- Patagonia is a [[B Corp]], and a member of [[B Lab]]- working to promote new forms of business which are less destructive. this also bakes in Patagonia's values to its charter- were it ever to be sold, these values would need to be kept without a 100% vote to change them.
	- ## human resource philosophy
	  collapsed:: true
		- > A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play; his labor and his leisure; his mind and his body; his education and his recreation. He hardly knows which is which He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing, and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. To himself, he always appears to be doing both.
		  â L.P. Jacks
		- Patagonia has no dividing line between those that make the products and those that use them. the interest of the customer should be the same as that of the employee.
		- Patagonia should feel like home for people who feel a bit alienated, as early climber culture did, and who want to change the world. environmentalism, [[opposition to unnecessary heirarchy]], [[anti-consumerism]], and opposition to a passive approach to life. these values are familiar there.
			- **culture.** to maintain a culture, you need to hire the right people, treat them right, and train them to treat other people right. otherwise the culture you built will vanish out from under you!
				- Patagonia wants ensembles players, not folks who seek the limelight
				- Patagonia also seeks users of their core products
				- in the US, 50% of upper management are women
				- as much as possible, they hire from within
			- **benefits.** Patagonia values employees who lead rich, rounded lives. that requires benefits that support those lives.
				- Patagonia has flexible hours- as long as the work gets done, without negatively impacting others. this is the "Let My People Go Surfing" flextime policy.
				- health insurance is offered even to part-timers- if it was only for full-timers, they wouldn't be able to entice pro outdoorsmen to part-time.
				- onsite child care is provided, because parents are more productive if they don't have to worry about their kids' safety. Patagonia's childcare is even bilingual! and parents are encouraged to take time out to say hi to their kids. and childcare is in fact a profit center, not a wasted expense- it would cost a lot more to replace all the highly-qualified parents, than it does to care for their children.
				- onsite food is healthy and organic
				- showers are provided, so folks can pursue sport on breaks
	- ## management philosophy
	  collapsed:: true
		- > It's not the strongest species that survives, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change.
		  â Charles Darwin
		- Patagonia doesn't want drones to order around- they want folks who will think for themselves.
			- see also [[independent thinking obedience]]!
		- *since* they don't want mindless drones, it follows that they have to either be convinced that what they're doing is right, or see for themselves that it is.
		- rejects the idea of management by sitting behind a screen and telling people what to do. you need to get out with your people, and build consensus
		- Patagonia doesn't have private offices, and is all open-plan
		- > Systems in nature appear to us to be chaotic but in reality are very structured, just not in a top-down centralized way. Deborah Gordon, a professor at Stanford University who studies ant colonies, says that there is no specific ant in charge in a colony, no central control. Yet each ant knows what its job is, and ants communicate with one another by way of very simple interactions; altogether they produce a very effective social network.
		- top-down systems of control take huge amounts of force to keep together, and eventually collapse
		- it's important to know the difference between a manager and a leader. a manager is here to keep things cruising along as they currently are. a leader is here to take risks, have a long-term vision, and instigate change.
		- leadership runs on trust, and trust should be built by example
		- Yvon has found that, when senior leaders leave, there's little chaos- the work continues as though they were still there. they build a self-regulating system. #[[transition planning]]
			- kinda like the Tao Te Ching- "With the greatest leader above them, people barely know one exists."
		- keeping the company smallish helps keep it manageable. Yvon believes that ideally, no more than 100 people would work from one location.
			- similar to how democracy works best in small societies, and many social issues and specialized roles don't appear until a society is big enough for people to no longer feel personal responsibility and direct impact.
			- also references [[Creativity in Small Groups]], suggesting that groups of 4 to 7 are more successful at problem solving, because they're more egalitarian.
		- Patagonia has always had a CEO, in addition to Yvon & Malinda's leadership. it's hard to find a CEO that's good at everything. but according to a study, one thing all good CEOs have in common is, they work with their hands. they have the problem-solving skills to tackle a problem with their own hands. that's directly proportional to the skills to solve problems and adapt in the workplace.
		- the effective CEO doesn't immediately hire a consultant when a problem crops up. consultants don't know your business the way you do, and often come from failed businesses anyway.
		- brings up the [[Five Whys]] and [[Toyota Production System]]
		- layoffs should be avoided at all costs, only a last resort
		- owners of a business who want it to be around in 100 years had better love change! the most important role of a manager is to instigate change. change is an opportunity to grow and evolve to a higher level.
		- uses the analogy of climbing Everest. you can do it by yourself. or you can do it with the help of a team that does all the hard stuff for you, so you don't have to do any work. but that latter option misses the point of climbing Everest in the first place- the challenge that forces you to rise to it.
			- similarly, just like risk sports force you to grow, a company should constantly stress itself in order to cause growth.
			- > When there is no crisis, the wise leader or CEO will create one. Not by crying wolf but by challenging the employees with change.
			- when times are good, it's important to move on, just as when times are bad! easy living leads to complacency, which will ruin you when a real crisis hits.
			- quotes [[Teddy Roosevelt]]'s "In pleasant peace and security, how quickly the soul of a man begins to die". and [[Bob Dylan]]'s "He not busy being born is busy dying."
	- ## environmental philosophy
		- > Anyone who thinks you can have infinite growth on a finite planet is either a madman or an economist.
		  âKenneth Boulding
		- Yvon is a pessimist about our treatment of the natural world, as are many environmentalists and natural scientists. we may be in the middle of another great extinction, of our own making.
		- references E.O. WIlson's [[The Future of Life]], calling our time "nature's last stand"
		- but despite being a pessimist, you gotta do something. if you don't, the impact is the same as the naive optimist who insists everything is fine.
		- Yvon also believes that evil, generally speaking, is stronger than good- over time, things have generally tended to work more evil.
		- but he takes a [[Buddhist]] view of it all. things change, and there's a beginning and end to everything. perhaps even the human species.
		- the key to doing the right thing is to plan on the premise that we'll still be around in 100 years. if we did, our actions would probably look a lot less short-sighted.
		- "sustainable" is a word so overused it's become meaningless, like "gourmet". there are only a few *truly* sustainable economic endeavors that Yvon thinks can be done at all, other than on the microscale. selective forestry, fishing, and large-scale agriculture.
		- the [[Green Revolution]] in agriculture is completely nonsustainable. to feed the entire world the way Americans eat would use up the world's petroleum reserves in a few short years.
		- talks about the struggle of starting his own garden, even just getting the soil to be nutritious enough to grow
		- think of the inside of Patagonia like an ecosystem. it has a lot of interdependent parts in a dynamic equilibrium. messing with or eliminating one part would have unexpected consequences on the others. that's exactly what's happening in the environment!
		- environmental damage is the result of a mismatch between short-term busines principles and long-term impact. neither businesses nor governments use [[full-cost accounting]] that takes environmental harms into account. we measure success by GDP, not by cleanliness of the environment.
		- wilderness is perhaps the most radical idea of all- nature that exists for its own sake, and not for any human's. it's gone, increasingly. if you define wilderness as a place that's more than a day's walk from human habitation, there is no true wilderness left in America.
		- elements of Patagonia's environmental philosophy:
			- **lead an examined life**
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- Yvon doesn't really believe that humans are evil, just ignorant. we're the only animal stupid enough to foul our own nest. we don't think about the negative consequences of what we do, and we have blind faith that things will turn out alright.
				- so instead, we need to ask ourselves lots of hard questions.
				- corporations exist to accrue profit, and limited liability allows their owners to economically, psychologically, and legally ignore the consequences they inflict. that's just how it works. to ignore this would be to ignore the whole history and practices of our culture, the incentives we have, everything.
				- Patagonia started with just a concern about non-wasteful, high-quality gear, and leaving to trace when climbing. but the environmentalism grew. in 1991, Patagonia began looking for the environmental "land mines" in its own business practices and found many terrible ones!
				- following the [[Five Whys]] is hard because asking follow-up questions might lead you to the real source of your problems and force you to change, or accept guilt. and there's endless money to be made in working on symptoms. so most of us don't address the cause.
				- we need to admit that yes, _we_ caused this environmental mess, and so we should clean it up. each of us, as individuals.
			- **clean up our own act**
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- before we can encourage _others_ to act responsible, we have to do so *ourselves*. leading by example is the only option.
				- you have to go deeper than buzzwords that look nice.
					- just asking for "organic cotton" wasn't good enough for Patagonia to be confident it's environmentally-friendly- need to know where the water comes from that the farm uses!
					- just offering "recycling" of polyester clothing didn't have high uptake- turned out, consumers were attached to their clothes, and what they really wanted was _repair_
				- while being more environmentally conscious is costly upfront, it's often resulte din long-term savings. so doing the right thing often paid off too
				- but the problems get harder the wider the scope is. it's hard enugh just inside the company. at the scale of society, it's brutal!
					- while Patagonia tries to focus on reducing nonrenewable use until it can be fully substituted with renewables, governments focus on kicking the can and subsidizing pet industries, like lumber
				- company sustainability efforts should include individual employees! Patagonia doesn't just tithe profits for the environment, it has a matching program to encourage employees to donate to their own favorite environmental groups too.
					- they also subsidize public transit, walking, and biking via a Drive Less program
					- and, they allow employees to bring in home recycling
				- employees are encouraged to spend company time getting involved with Patagonia's environmental efforts. for example, the declaration of the Black Rock Desert in Nevada as wilderness was an employee project
				- people want a better future for their children, but don't act on it. some of us rationalize the bad choices. other see 'em , but can't change 'em due to the insitutional factors that caused 'em, like the governments we choose. and it's easier to blame _others_, than it is to change *yourself*.
					- in all these cases, folks end up thinking: "I'm not the problem, so I'm not the solution."
				- brings up [[Silent Spring]] as the thing that shook him out of his [[dogmatic slumber]]
			- **do our penance**
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- part of responsibility is paying  for one's sins when they aren't avoidable.
				- after the OPEN crisis, Japan and Europe taxes petroleum products, causing them to develop conservations measures. the US did not. that's part of why we're as bad with fossil fuels as we are today.
			- **support civil democracy**

			- **do good**

			- **influence other companies**
