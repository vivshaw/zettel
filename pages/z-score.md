- a **z-score** can be used to normalize observations that are [[normally distributed]]. it does so by calculating how far the observation is from the mean, in [[standard deviation]] units.
	- `z = (x - mu) / sigma`
	- sometimes, you may not have the population data, and may need to work from a sample. in that case, you might calculate `z = (x - x_bar) / S`. (this is technically the [[t-score]].)
