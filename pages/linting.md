- what's the benefit of stricter linting?
	- reducing cognitive load. our job is to reduce the number of decisions an engineer has to make per day, until they only have to make decisions about what matters.
	- preventing creep after a change to reduce application surface area
	- can remove the need for certain types of test
	- can help improve [[accessibility]] without requiring everyone to be an expert
	- lints with good error messages can be a sort of "distributed education", brought directly to the point of implementation
