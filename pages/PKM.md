tags:: notes

- i'm interested in compiling my various notes and knowledge into a personal knowledge management system.
	- i've found that the [[outliner]] approach works best for me, like [[Roam Research]] or [[Logseq]].
	- Logseq won out due to being local-first and [[Markdown]]ish
	- after a few months of daily use, i've grown it into a [[digital garden]] that I make publicly [via GitHub](https://github.com/vivshaw/zettel) and [[vivsha.ws]] (at [zettel.vivsha.ws](https://zettel.vivsha.ws/))
