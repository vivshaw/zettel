- gross profit margin, defined as a percent of revenue:
	- gross margin = [[gross profits]] / [[revenue]] * 100
- physical product companies tend to have lower gross margin, and software companies tend to have very high gross margin. why? because software companies have very low [[COGS]]- most expenses are payroll, which is [[operating expenses]] rather than COGS! #nuggets
