- **motors** tend to rotate
	- electric motors use electromagnetism to force a shaft to rotate
		- AC motors use the alternation of [[AC current]] to do this at the frequency of the current.
		- DC motors are most often **brushed DC motors**- they use **commutators**, brushes that intermittently apply current, to artificially swap the polarity. as the motor rotates, sometimes it is in contact with one brush, sometimes the other. this causes the polarity swap
		- there are also **brushless DC motors**, which instead use sensors to determine the rotor's position, then switch the polarity accordingly.
	- stepper motors can do this in discrete steps
- **linear actuators** apply force in one direction
