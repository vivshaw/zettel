- > A phenomenon will be said to be controlled when, through the use of past experience, we can predict at least within limits, how that phenomenon may be expected to vary in the future.
  â€” Shewhart (1931)
- a process which has only [[common cause]] variation is **in statistical control**. its variation is stable and predictable.
- a process which also has [[special cause]] variation is **out of statistical control**. its variation is unstable and unpredictable.
- originally, [[quality (SPC)]] was seen as a product's conformance to design. this leads to a **product control cycle**, primarily about ensuring the outputs are within spec. this is primarily reactive, and largely about "inspecting it in" after the goods are produced.
- a newer approach is a **process control cycle**, where the process is seen as part of the cycle.
	- a first phase might be about "controlling it in". the process itself will be modified based on what we learn from sampled output.
	- a second phase might be about "building it in". we will use samples of input and the process itself (via control charts), to adjust the process and design.
