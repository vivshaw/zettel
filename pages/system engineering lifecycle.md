- the lifecycle:
	- **planning**
		- determine why we need this system. is there a gap in capabilities or knowledge?
		- determine whether there's actually demand for the system
		- develop a few rough concepts that might fill the need
		- do a feasibility analysis, to select the best approach from among those concepts based on cost and timeline
		- estimate a budget for the system
		- **output:**
			- our first draft of requirements (usually called **operational requirements**)
			- our preferred concept for the system
	- **development**
		- design, verification, and initial production all happen in here!
		- gather requirements for all the system components
		- do our top-down system design tasks: define the architecture and the system's interfaces
		- do our bottom-up system design tasks: integrate individual components into higher-level systems
		- test our system!
		- start building out our production process, which will require documentation, automation, and tooling.
		- **output:**
			- detailed specs for the system and all its components
			- system test procedures and plans
			- a low-volume production line
	- **production**
		- we build the thing!
		- validate that the production process runs smoothly
		- establish process controls
		- work to eliminate waste - this is where [[lean]] and such comes in!
	- **sustainment**
		- do maintenance on the system
		- upgrade the system to support new capabilities
		- address defects that we discover after going to production
		- train system users on how to use it effectively
	- **disposal**
		- when do we retire the system? what do we do with it once we do? disposal, storage, etc.
- we should...
	- adopt a lifecycle view as early as possible. the early stages is where a lot of the most critical things are locked in.
	- see the lifecycle as cyclical! all systems are eventually retired, and new systems arise in their place
