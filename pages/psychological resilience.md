- a "dynamic process encompassing positive adaptation within the context of significant [[adversity]]" (Luthar et al., 2000)
- when knocked out of your comfort zone, how effectively can you get back into [[homeostasis]]?
- connected to:
	- strong social connections
	- [[locus of control]]. psychologically resilient people tend to have an internal locus of control. we don't find adverse everts as stressful when we think they are controllable!
	- compassion, including for oneself
	- good problem-solving skills
- how can you train yourself to be more resilient?
	- **cognitive reappraisal.** what is the story you're telling yourself about your hardship? how emotinally attached are you to it? how qualitative vs. objective are the judgments you're making?
	- **focus on what you can control.** drop or accept the things you can't.
	- **adapt.** try new things! what kind of person would you need to be to make it through this stressful situation OK?
	- **embrace adversity.** it's going to happen to you. it can even be positive and lead to growth! so, accept it when it's here, and even seek it out in manageable chunks when you feel able. that'll help you buiold your skill in doing hard things.
	- **savor the good things in life.** even when life is hard, there are valuable things. taking time to savor them will help you keep going.
