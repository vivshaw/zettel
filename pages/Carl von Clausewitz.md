- Prussian general in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, during the Napoleonic era. Author of the monumental work of military strategy, *Vom Kriege*
- saw Prussia's defeat at the hands of [[Napoleon]], and through military reform, helped turn it around and defeat Napoleon
- an opponent of [[von BÃ¼low]] , who believed war could be reduced to mathematical precision
- wrote about the true nature of war. from the outside it looks simple, but it is brutally complex. that is a gap between appearance and reality, between what we know and can do, between planning and execution.

- in war, "everything is very simple, but the simplest thing is difficult... taken action in war is movement in a resistant medium". he calls this *Friktion*. "Friction is the only concept which covers in fairly general terms what it is that makes the difference between real war and war on paper."

- **eight sources of friction:**
	- insufficient knowledge of the enemy
	- rumors
	- uncertainty about one's own strength and position
	- the uncertainties that cause friendly troops to exaggerate their own difficulties
	- differences between expectations and reality
	- the fact that one's own army is never as strong as it appears on paper
	- the difficulties in keeping an army supplied
	- the tendency to change her abandoned well thought out plans when confronted with the vivid physical images and perceptions of the battlefield
- **the nature of war**
	- > the primordial violence of its element, hatred and enmity, which can be considered to be *blind instinct*; the interplay of probabilities enchanted, which make it a *creative inner activity*; and its secondary nature is a tool of politics, which renders it a matter of *intellectual calculation*.

	  The task for theory, then, is to maintain itself suspended between these three tendencies as if they were three magnets.
- [[von Moltke]] would later become heir to these ideas, and develop them into the seeds of [[Auftragstaktik]]
