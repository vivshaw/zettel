- what's bad
	- difference between exposure and connection- social media _exposes_ us to many people different from ourselves, but does not _connect_ us to them. unlike irl, it decouples exposure and connection. this can accelerate outgroup hate and misunderstanding instead of reducing it.

		- this as the endpoint of a progressive decoupling as humanity
		- the monkeysphere / [[Dunbar's Number]] - you _can't_ be connected to that many folks. what social media is selling you is a pipe dream.
	- "any engagement is good engagement" - so hate-views are as good as positive interactions, and misinformation as good as info. maybe better, since rage is a primal and motivating interaction

	- filter bubbles, steering you against challenges to your own views, and toward more and more extreme versions of them

	- sousveillance - we know too much about one another. no privacy from one another. hate mobs and "callout culture" as different sides of the same coin.

	- surveillance - data harvesting, with the accompanying loss of privacy and security, as well as enabling...

	- behavior modification. aim to maximize service use with dopamine hacking / addictive potential, with accompanying shortening attention span. same in turn from advertisers. think of Cambridge Analytica

	- anonymity. reduction of internal feeling of accountability, online disinhibition effect, cyberbullying. state bad actors. botnets.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- stands in tension with the sousveillance and surveillance. we get the worst of both worlds. anonymity is critical to protect whistleblowers, political dissidents, targeted minorities... but services' omnisurveillance and doxxing swarms will identify them. anonymity provides cover for bad actors, but services are not incentivized to expose them. good actors reap all the harms of identifiability, bad actors enjoy all the benefits of anonymity.

- it is a Skinner box which is also a panopticon which is also a crab bucket. it is breaking our brains.
- what we need to do instead:
	- fight Dunbar's Number by extending the circle of care. instead of trying to connect to all people, build the ability to understand and empathize with those progressively further from you. cultivating [[lovingkindess]] toward all living beings, or the ability to "love one's enemy", etc... reference Schwitzgebel post...

	- align interaction incentives with virtue, truth-seeking, and prosociality
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- adopt "loose assortativity"- cultivate groups that have enough in common to have a core reason to be together and core shared understanding, but enough difference to protect against filter bubbles (and build real connection with those different from you). this means you'll hear things you don't want to hear, or meet people you don't understand.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- embrace limits & temporailty. the social should *not* be unlimited. who can see and interact with what should _at least_ be highly granular, possibly federated & fragmented. the social should *not* be immutable. our social artefacts and sphere should grow and change as we do, and the past should be able to be forgiven and forgotten.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- reject advertising-based funding models, and so, stop collecting data.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- embrace smaller, slower, and longer. longform posts/video/audio are a feature, shortform is poison. fast feedback cycles break your dopamine system. big numbers are worse. the platform should be _anti-viral_ and _anti-addictive_.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- develop pseudonymity with reputation. it should be possible for anyone to avoid tracing their content to their person, but equally, it should be possible to identify bad actors. reference to Sybil attacks, bot detection, etc.

- but these things stand in contrast to business success. you will never earn more money by convincing fewer users to adopt, or convincing existing users to use your service less. you will not find a profitable business model without advertiser-based funding- heck, most platforms stuggle even _with_ advertiser funding. and even if you get off the ground, every incentive will pull you against these principles.
	- if by some miracle the money and incentives were fixed, _you'd still lose_. if your services are designed to be anti-addictive, the addictive platforms will just slurp up your users.
- So markets will not save us. Market incentives align social media platforms to stunt human flourishing and destroy our wellbeing. Neither will I sell you snake-oil of some miraculous politico-economic system that fixes these woes. I'm interested in the world as it is, which keenly bears down on us with the chains of the actual in a way the merely possible never could.
- The remaining solution, then, is exodus. Do not use these services and do not build them. You cannot rewrite the world to work in this way, but you can at least still exercise your own choice to improve your own life.
