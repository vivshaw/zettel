- # Prologue
  collapsed:: true
	- riffs on the importance of becoming "21st century Buddhists"- people whose worldview is rooted both in the Buddha's compassion and wisdom, and in the many fields of modern knowledge, and even in other religions
	- points out that the practices of other Buddhist traditions aren't just sectarian nonsense- they exist for reasons, because they suited the people who practiced them
	- to achieve a harmonious society, each individual must cultivate peace within themselves first. Buddhism's goal goes beyond world peace and societal harmony, but can help us be more peaceful while we're here.
	- book will cite sources from:
		- the [[Nalanda]] tradition
		- [[Tsongkhapa]]
		- the [[Pali Canon]]
	- won't follow the traditional [[lamrim]] structure
- # Preface
  collapsed:: true
	- goes into the background of why Buddhist treatises and commentaries exist. it's thought that those who direct disciples of the Buddha were luckiest- they had great merit and could realize the path without lengthy explanations. the generation they taught afterward were not as sharp of mind, and more doubtful. so they required more explanation and instruction. and so on as the generations rolled on. so, the commentaries are a kindness of the sages- helping those of lesser merit to obtain insight.
	- think of the sutras like freshly picked cotton, the Indian treatises like woven cloth, and the lamrim like readymade clothes.
	- but cultural difference made it so that, as Buddhism came to the West, this wasn't so! our mindsets were so different that things that seemed obvious to the sages were alien to us, and fundamental Western concerns were unaddressed.
	- so, this book is meant to be a pre-lamrim text for the Western audience. it's broken into many parts, that will progressively build an understanding of the foundation of Buddhism. it's aimed not only at Westerners, but Buddhists and the curious from modern cultures all over the world.
- # Chapter 1: Exploring Buddhism
  collapsed:: true
	- a spiritual path is necessary for human life, because the pursuit of material things is not enough to satisfy. we've made incredible strides with science and technology, yet, we still suffer... and many times we've made new problems for ourselves along the way!
		- and so, it's necessary to transform the mind, not just satisfy the body.
	- [[the Buddha]] describing a [[monist]] and [[idealist]] picture of his teachings:
	  id:: 66382822-f622-42ef-bef3-745ada6d889d
		- > The world is led by mind and drawn along by mind. All phenomena are controlled by one phenomenon, mind.
		- *citta* means mind, but also means heart. it refers to all consciousness and mental states.
	- Buddhism aims to transform the mind by counteracting harmful internal mental states- harmful attitudes, false beliefs, toxic emotions...
		- they are counteracted with tools that are themselves mental.
	- the Buddha says that for the most part, beings want to avoid suffering and unwanted things, and want agreeable things to increase. yet, no matter how much beings wish for it, suffering happens, and agreeable things diminish and vanish
	- what's the purpose of existence? to Buddhists, there's not an overarching purpose to the universe- it's all causes and conditions, it's just nature. but we don't need to know how or why the world came into being to end our suffering.
		- so, the purpose of our lives is [[happiness]] and peace, internal, mental well-being. that's something we can all seek out and all want, regardless of the universe's purpose
		- accomplishing this requires material development and education. but it also requires spiritual development. but that doesn't mean rituals or belief- that means cultivating the positive qualities in our hearts that lead to positive development for others too. compassion, gentleness, humility...
	- humans differ from other animals due to our sentient minds. we don't just undergo physical suffering, of the body and senses. we undergo mental suffering. and that comes from the mind, so can be counteracted in the mind.
	- many people don't care about religion, and are focused on their material needs. ()but even among them, those who follow an ethical code are happier than those who don't!) some people follow religion sincerely, and use its practices to guide their ethical lives. others _oppose_ religion deliberately, because they believe it to be wrong- perhaps a tool of exploitation, perhaps a harmful superstition.
		- what all these groups have in common is, they want happiness.
		- what differs is how they seek it, what they believe will bring happiness to them.
	- Buddhism can be seen in different ways depending on perspective. in one view, it is a religion, belonging to a long spiritual tradition. in another, it is a "science of mind", linked inextricably to mental practice. in another, since it does not believe in a creator God, it is a philosophy. really, it's all of these!
	- Buddhism, unlike many religions, encourages skepticism, experimentation, and logic- even about the Buddha's own words. but unlike material science, it recognizes that mind and the senses are limited, and that faith and spirituality have a place. in this sense, it can perhaps be seen as a "middle way" between religion and science.
		- mutual understanding between Buddhists, other religious people, and scientists is real and valuable!
	- each religion has two aspects: transformation of the heart, and the philosophy to reach that transformation.
		- in a sense, all religions agree on many things about the transformation of the heart: love, compassion, forgiveness, generosity, abstaining from harm...
		- but the philosophy of how to get there differs wildly!
		- for theists, the reason to love all beings is because one loves the Creator, and so one should love the creation.
		- for Buddhists, the reason in non-theistic. it's about cause and effect. our actions are the causes for our future experiences. to achieve good things, we must abandon destructive actions which cause bad things.
		- which views are the right fit may differ from person to person! there isn't necessarily one right path.
			- even within Buddhism, the Buddha taught multiple different paths!
		- what's important is not which religion one follows. it is to dedicate oneself to it seriously, change one's life in accordance with it, and sincerely cultivate kindness and tolerance.
	- the Dalai Lama does not go out preaching for converts. in fact, when non-Buddhists coem to him to learn, he often advocates that they not think about becoming Buddhists! if their current religion and philosophies fit, they should stick with them and practice them authentically. but if they find that Buddhism fits better, then perhaps they can become one, or [[syncretize]] and adapt some practice of Buddhism into their existing religion.
		- you don't need to _be_ a Buddhist to benefit from the Buddha's teachings. if some of the teachings make sense to you and help you out, practice them!
	- religion today faces three primary challenges: [[Communism]], modern science, and [[consumerism]]/[[materialism]]
	- there's no one single meditation technique to Dharma practice. it's a whole worldview, and many practices. you need to encounter them on their own terms, and investigate to see if they fit your experience. don't reject them just because they're different, or accept them just 'cause Buddha said so.
	- contemplating suffering is necessary to overcome it. it might be hard and unpleasant, but the suffering will be there whether we think about it or not. it will strike us unaware.
	- the Dalai Lama is just a human being like us- nothing special. that's why we can relate, why we can express ourselves to one another.
- # Ch. 2: The Buddhist View of Life
  collapsed:: true
	- > Someone with a mind stained with afflictions is a being in [[samsara]]. Someone who has eradicated all *afflictive obscurations* - mental afflictions and the [[karma]] causing rebirth in samsara - is a liberated being, an [[arhat]].
		- the [[Ratnagotravibhaga]] speaks of _three_ kinds of beings- polluted beings, unpolluted beings, and _completely_ unpolluted beings (buddhas)
	- ## what is mind? #[[philosophy of mind]]
		- how should we understand mind?
			- in science, we approach it via [[neurology]] and the actions of neurons, [[behavioral psychology]] and people's actions or speech, [[cognitive science]] and measurable behaviors or brain activity.
			- others think of it as an immaterial [[soul]].
			- none of these approaches tell us much about what conscious experience is actually like!
		- in Buddhism, the mind and body are different but related. the mind is what experiences and makes sentient. it is not identical with the brain.
		- see previously: ((66382822-f622-42ef-bef3-745ada6d889d))
		- the mind is "clarity and cognizance"- clarity meaning it's not material, and also that it can reflect objects, *cognizance* meaning it can engage with those objects
		- the mind changes from moment to moment, and is subject to causes and conditions
		- each moment of mind is caused by the previous. this continuous stream of changing mind is called the [[mindstream]]
		- the mind has two natures:
			- its *conventional* nature (how it functions and relates to stuff)
			- its *ultimate* nature (its true mode of existence)
		- emotions are *not* the nature of the mind, as it can be dominated by one at one time, and another at another.
		- > Our body is like a house, and the mind is its inhabitant. As long as the body remains, the mind is a long-term resident. However, various mental factors — which include emotions and attitudes — are like visitors. One day resentment comes, another day compassion comes, but neither remains long. While both are visitors, one visitor is respectful, useful, and pleasant — like someone reliable whom we can trust and want to make a member of the family. We invite that visitor to remain in the house all the time and cultivate the conditions so that she will. Meanwhile, the other visitor is rude and disturbs our own and others’ peace. We don’t want him to visit let alone move in, so we do not invite him in and evict him if he sneaks in. Similarly, it is possible to banish anger and cultivate compassion limitlessly, making it our constant companion.
		- the ultimate nature of the mind is emptiness of inherent or independent existence. it doesn't have its own findable essence, above the cause and conditions, above the sum of its parts. but though the mind is emptiness, it exists!
		- in [[the Buddha]]'s words:
			- > The mind is devoid of mind, for the nature of mind is clear light.
			  — [[Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita Sutra]]
		- *ignorance* is the mental factor that sees things as existing inherently. it's the cause of many other disturbing emotions. but it's not inherently part of mind, so it can be eliminated!
		- but other factors, like love, wisdom, and compassion *don't* depend on ignorance. so they can stay.
		- **reflections:**
			- The conventional nature of the mind is clarity and cognizance, meaning the mind can reflect and cognize objects.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- The conventional nature of the mind is pure: the afflictions have not entered into its nature, although they may temporarily color or obscure the mind.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- The body is material in nature; it is like a house, and the mind is its immaterial inhabitant.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- The ultimate nature of the mind is empty of inherent existence; it lacks any essence that is findable when we search for how the mind ultimately exists.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- ## body, mind, rebirth, and the self
		- there's a difference between the pain we experience when bad things happen to ourselves, and the pain when they happen to others. but to current cognitive science, pain is pain- we can't tell them apart.
		- everything comes from causes and conditions. for the body, that's your parents, and the generations of ancestors before them
			- according to the [[Kalacakra Tantra]], the ultimate source of the body is space particles that exist between the beginning and ending of universes, which contain within them traces of all the elements.
				- interesting parallels to [[the Big Bang]] and the [[interstellar medium]]!
		- results are produced only by *concordant* causes. since the mind is immaterial, its cause must also be.
		- conception is when the sperm, egg, and *subtle mind* come together into one being. that mind can't have come from a physical thing, so it must have come from the mind of a past being.
		- at death, the body becomes a corpse and decays, but the mind can't. so it must go on, usually as the mind of another being.
		- there are several levels of mind in Buddhist scriptures
			- **coarse consciousness**, like our sensory awareness
			- **subtler consciousness**, like our mental faculties
			- **subtlest consciousness**, like what moves between lives after death
		- the subtlest mind isn't an innate thing. neither is the fundamental, innate mind of clear light. they are just a continuum of subtle, transitory moments of mind. and that's the type of mind that persists.
			- interesting parallels here to Western [[panpsychism]] or [[panentheism]], or even to [[absolute idealism]]
		- it's important to know what the self is, because of all our wishes for ourselves. how can I follow through on a wish for me to be happy , if I don't know what "I" and "me" are?
		- the Buddha teaches that a person is made of five aggregates ([[skandhas]]): form, feelings, discrimination, miscellaneous factors, and consciousness. the form is the body, and the other four are the mind.
			- aka, the five aggregates of clinging ([[pañcupādānakkhandhā]])
		- the self depends on both the body and mind. but it *isn't* either. nor is it anything else. when we search for it, we can't find it. it exists dependently. but _because_ it exists dependently, it can change, we can grow and progress to awakening.
		- the incongruity between our everyday view of the self and its ultimate nature is the cause of all our confusion and suffering
		- **reflections:**
			- The body is material in nature; the mind is immaterial. While the brain and the mind influence each other, they are not the same.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Our body and its substantial cause — the sperm and egg of our parents — are both material. Our mind and its substantial cause — the previous moment of mind — are immaterial; they are mere clarity and cognizance. At the time of conception they meet, forming a new life.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- At the time of death, the continuity of the body is a corpse that decomposes to become material elements. The continuity of mind in the form of the very subtle mind continues to the next life.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- ## the four truths of the Aryas
		- the [[four noble truths]], or four truths of the Aryas, are the foundation of the Buddhist path
			- the **truth of [[duhkha]]**: our five aggregates aren't satsfactory
			- the **true origins of dukkha**: the causes of the [[Pañcupādānakkhandhā]] are mental afflictions (primarily ignorance) and polluted actions
			- the **true cessation**: you can achieve liberation from suffering by extinguishing these afflictions and ceasing these actions
			- the **true path**: the Buddhist path can lead you to liberation
		- while [[nirvana]] may same far away, we can see and take steps that point there. as we do so, we'll experience greater tranquility and fulfillment.
		- what sorts of [[duhkha]] are there? the Buddha spoke of three:
			- the **dukkha of pain**: physical and mental suffering.
				- most people and most philsophies recognize and agree on this.
			- the **dukkha of change**: worldly happiness, which does not satisfy, because it does not continue. the things that used to make us happy stop doing making us happy. or, they cease to exist.
				- parallels to the [[hedonic treadmill]]
				- most people _don't_ recognize this, but many religions do. mystics often abandon worldly things in pursuit of the spiritual for this reason
			- the **dukkha of conditioning**: the fact that we have a body and mind that aren't under our control. our bodies will grow old and die. we can't get all the things we seek.
				- pretty much only Buddhism thinks this way
		- and so, the [[Three Jewels]] are unique!
		- the Buddha didn't create things this way- he just described the world as he saw it. it's up to each of us to test his wisdom for ourselves.
		- **reflections:**
			- The first two of the four truths of the āryas describe our present experience: we are subject to three main types of unsatisfactory circumstances: pain, change, and pervasive conditioning. These are rooted in ignorance of the ultimate nature of reality.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- The last two of the four truths describe possibilities: a state of freedom from ignorance and duḥkha exists, and a path to that state also exists.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- It is up to us to learn and reflect on these to gain conviction in them and to cultivate wisdom in order to free ourselves.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- ## dependent arising and emptiness
		- [[Madhyamaka]] speaks of three levels of [[dependent arising]]
			- **causal dependence**, the fact that results depend on causes #causality
				- [[karma]] is another system of causal dependence.
			- **dependent designation**, which has two branches:
				- **mutual dependence**, in which things exist only in relation. e.g., long and short, parent and child, whole and part...
				- **mere designation by term and concept**, in which we just give a name to a collection of things. like "body" for all our body parts together, and "person" for the blob of physical and mental things that we are
		- *all phenomena* are dependent. *all* are empty of independent existence.
	- ## dependent arising and the three jewels
		- > Monastics, whoever sees dependent arising sees the Dharma. Whoever sees the Dharma sees the Tathāgata [the Buddha].
		  [[the Buddha]], [[Salistamba Sutra]]
		- this is due to a process of progressively increasing our understanding. we gradually come to understand the Dharma through careful investigation of the causes of experience, and the discovery that things are dependent.
		- [[emptiness]] and [[dependent arising]] complement, they don't contradict. all things are empty, and all things exist, but not in the way we thought them to exist.
		- strong emotions rely on the assumption that we exist inherently- but we do not.
		- when we realize emptiness, the ultimate mode of existence, we shed our fundamental ignorance and are liberated
		- > I believe this statement of the Buddha could also mean that by seeing dependent arising on the level of conventional appearance, we see causal relationships and understand karma, compassion, bodhicitta, and the method aspect of the path. Through accomplishing the method aspect of the path, we come to “see” — that is, actualize — the form body (rūpakāya) of a buddha. By understanding dependent arising in relation to the ultimate mode of existence, we experience the meaning of emptiness — the suchness (tathatā) of all phenomena — and by that, we “see” (actualize) the truth body (dharmakāya) of a buddha, a buddha’s mind, specifically an awakened one’s wisdom of ultimate reality. In this way, both the body and mind of a buddha are actualized.
		- **reflections:**
			- All persons and phenomena exist in dependence on other factors. There are three types of dependence: causal dependence (for impermanent things only), mutual dependence, and mere designation by terms and concept.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Dependent arising contradicts the possibility of independent or inherent existence. Understanding this can eradicate grasping inherent existence, the root of our duḥkha in cyclic existence.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- The wisdom that eradicates ignorance (the true paths) and the freedom from duḥkha that comes about due to it (true cessations) are the Dharma Jewel.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- People who have actualized the Dharma Jewel in their minds are the Saṅgha Jewel and the Buddha Jewel. Thus the Three Jewels of refuge exist.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- ## the possibility of ending duhkha
		- liberation is possible for two reasons:
			- **the clear-light nature of the mind**, its capacity to cognize objects, the clear and cognizant nature
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- **the adventitious nature of the defilements**, the fact that ignorance has an antidote and thus can be removed
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- there are two types of obstructions that block us:
			- **afflictive obstructions**, which prevent liberation from samsara
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- **cognitive obscurations**, which prevent [[omniscience]]
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- speaks a lot about [[Nagarjuna]] and [[Aryadeva]], including the [[Sunyatasaptati]] and [[Mulamadhamakakarika]]
		- cyclic existence does not arise without a cause, or from a discordant cause. it arises from an ignorant, undisciplined mind.
		- references [[Dharmakirti]]'s [[Pramanavarttika]] in saying that ignorant mental states have no foundation, and wise states do.
		- in the Buddhist approach, erroneous mental states can be diminished by cultivating their opposites. they're not removed through prayer, the Buddha's power, or concentration [[samadhi]]. they're removed through our own effort to understand and act rightly.
		- since we can separate the defilement from mind, the ultimate nature of the mind must be free from defilement. this ultimate nature is called [[Buddha-nature]].
- # Ch. 3: Mind and Emotions #[[philosophy of emotion]]
	- humans are emotional beings. but some of our emotions lead to harm, and others to happiness. both on the personal and societal level, it's worthwhile to cultivate the good ones and subdue the negative ones.
	- Buddhas have eliminated all *afflictive* emotions, but that doesn't mean they're emotionless! on the contrary, while gradually overcoming the negative emotions, they've built up incredible amounts of constructive emotions, like love and compassion.
	- ## Buddhism, science, and emotion
		- science generally describes [[emotion]] as having 3 parts: physiological, experiential, and behavioral
		- from a Buddhist perspective, emotions are mental states and subjective experiences. (Buddhism doesn't deny that the mind and body influence each other, though!) emotions are mental states in living beings. there's no emotion without mind.
		- there's some difference in primacy between the scientific and Buddhist view. where many scientists view the physiological brain event as the cause, Buddhists view the mental state as prior to the physiological changes.
		- our [[actions]] are generally preceded by [[intentions]], which in turn are preceded by our emotions
		- cultivating well-being and positive emotion can have physiological effects! [[neuroplasticity]] allows the brain to adapt over time.
		- what differentiates positive and negative emotion? not how they feel in the moment! it's about the long-term beenfit or harm that comes from them.
			- > Here, when someone feels a certain kind of pleasant feeling, nonvirtuous states increase in him and virtuous states diminish; but when someone feels another kind of pleasant feeling, nonvirtuous states diminish in him and virtuous states increase. Here, when someone feels a certain kind of painful feeling, nonvirtuous states increase in him and virtuous states diminish; but when someone feels another kind of painful feeling, nonvirtuous states diminish in him and virtuous states increase.
			  — the Buddha
		- **reflections:**
			- When you act against your ethical values, how do you feel at the moment of doing the action? How do you feel later, when reflecting on your action?
			- When you give up an immediate pleasure due to your sense of personal integrity or for the sake of long-term happiness, how do you feel at the time? How do you feel later, when reflecting on your action?
			- How integral is ethical conduct to your happiness? Based on what you conclude here, make some determinations about how you want to live.
	- ## emotions and kleshas
		- there's not an exact parallel word for "emotion" in Tibetan. in Buddhist terminology, there are things like [[vedanas]] and [[kleshas]], neither quite exactly the same
		- ### attachment
			- [[attachment]] is a tricky word. it can refer to something very important and valuable- our connections and closeness to other humans. but it can also refer to one of the [[three poisons]] and [[six root afflictions]]
			- attachment can be sneaky! the positive thing we call attachment can turn into the negative thing!
			- pursuing the Buddha and nirvana is not attachment. but there is the possibility for subtle attachment to distorted views of them to arise. careful practice and education will help dispel this.
			- **reflections:**
				- What are some of the common meanings of the English word attachment?
				- What are the disadvantages of the afflictive type of attachment?
				- Is it easy to tell when attachment in the sense of affection and respect slips into exaggeration and expectations?
		- ### fear
			- fear also has a double aspect. the sort of fear that is panic, anxiety, and distress is indeed negative. but another kind of fear has an element of wisdom, and warns us of real possible danger.
			- some meditations are designed to deliberately provoke the wise kind of fear!
			- historically, some Buddhists would meditate in dangerous situations to cultivate fearlessness
			- it's sometimes said that a [[bodhisattva]] has fear of [[samsara]] and [[nirvana]]. this isn't the negative kind of fear, it's rooted in a desire to aid all sentient beings as soon as possible
		- ### anger
			- anger tends to be destructive, even when it feels justified. even moral outrage at unjust conditions. sure, it can spur us to cause change and tackle injustice. but so can [[compassion]]. compassion doesn't mean passivity! it means actively intervening to help, without anger or hatred.
			- the sutra path sees all anger as a distortion. the tantra path sees anger as possible to use on the path, in some circumstances.
		- ### disillusionment
			- another double aspect. often it's negative and leads us to depression and cynicism. but disillusionment with samsara is accurate and healthy!
	- ## emotions and survival
		- there's a biological basis for emotions. positive or negative, they help us to survive.
		- why then do Buddhists see them as afflictions? well, they perform their function, but they do so in an unreasonable way, full of exaggeration and grasping.
		- by examining the afflictions over time, we'll eventually get tired of them running our lives. then we can make a decision to consciously cultivate positive emotions in their place.
		-
