- **Agile values:**
	- > We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
	  1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
	  2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
	  3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
	  4. Responding to change over following a plan
	  That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
- **12 Principles of Agile:**
	- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
	  through early and continuous delivery
	  of valuable software.
	- Welcome changing requirements, even late in
	  development. Agile processes harness change for
	  the customer's competitive advantage.
	- Deliver working software frequently, from a
	  couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
	  preference to the shorter timescale.
	- Business people and developers must work
	  together daily throughout the project.
	- Build projects around motivated individuals.
	  Give them the environment and support they need,
	  and trust them to get the job done.
	- The most efficient and effective method of
	  conveying information to and within a development
	  team is face-to-face conversation.
	- Working software is the primary measure of progress.
	- Agile processes promote sustainable development.
	  The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
	  to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
	- Continuous attention to technical excellence
	  and good design enhances agility.
	- Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
	  of work not done--is essential.
	- The best architectures, requirements, and designs
	  emerge from self-organizing teams.
	- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
	  to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
	  its behavior accordingly.
