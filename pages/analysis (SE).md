- **analysis** is a task that uses well-founded analytic technique, like mathematical or computer models, to understand the system or an element in it.
	- we might use analysis together with data we gather from [[syseng/testing]] to build confidence that the results are as expected.
- we need to be careful with analysis! in the messy real world, every model is slightly wrong. so, if we're going to analyze a model, we should first validate that model via [[syseng/testing]] if we want to be sure we're right.
