- a package for goodness-of-fit testing for distributions.
- `fitdist()` will fit a distribution, and `gofstat()` will calculate goodness-of-fit values.
- also provides some graphing utilities for visual assessment:
	- `cdfcomp()` will graph against the [[cumulative distribution function]]
	- `denscomp()` will graph against the [[density function]]
	- `qqcomp()` will compare the quantiles
	- `ppcomp()` will compare probabilities to probabilities
