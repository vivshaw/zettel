- aka "inventory turns", how many times per year is [[inventory]] replaced?
- inventory turnover = [[COGS]] / [[inventory]]
- a good ratio depends on the industry!
	- a high turnover ratio might be desirable if you work in a sector with rapid innovation, where months-old goods become outdated
	- a low turnover ratio might be desirable if you're in a sector with stable, slow change and highly capital-intensive goods
	- you should compare also against similar firms! you don't want to be behind the market
