alias:: independent samples, dependent samples

- in an **independent sample**:
	- each item within a given sample is independent from all the others in that sample
	- each item within a given sample is independent from all the items in the *second* sample
- in a **dependent sample**:
	- each item within a given sample is independent from all the others in that sample
	- each item in one group is somehow related to a correspondihng item in the *second* sample
- we might have dependent samples if, for example:
	- we're measuring the same item more than once
	- we're pairing items deliberately
