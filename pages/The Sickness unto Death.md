- similar to [[The Concept of Anxiety]], addresses despair and anxiety as sin
- appeals to [[Socrates]] and against the crowd, and uses the negative of Socratic ignorance to guard Christianity against the mistaken positive views of his day
	- > Socrates, Socrates, Socrates! Yes, we may well call your name three times: it would not be too much to call it ten times, if it would be of any help. Popular opinion maintains that the world needs a republic, needs a new social order and a new religion—but no one considers that what the world, confused simply by too much knowledge, needs is Socrates.
	  Kierkegaard (*The Sickness unto Death*, trans. by Howard V. Hong and Edna H. Hong, Princeton: Princeton University Press 1980, p. 92.)
- Christianity can't and ought not be understood discursively
	- > I consider it an outright ethical task, perhaps requiring not a little self-denial in these very speculative times, when all 'the others' are busy comprehending [Christianity], to admit that one is neither able nor obliged to comprehend it. Precisely, this is no doubt what our age what Christendom needs: a little Socratic ignorance with respect to Christianity.
