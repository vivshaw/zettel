- a [[firm]] or sector will go through certain stages over its life:
	- untested - new and uncertain ideas, might disrupt things, might fail
	- growth - the idea starts to catch on! the firm grows rapidly and sustainably. there's fast change, and constant adaptation.
	- shakeout - the industry consolidates around some clear winners
	- maturity - large firms become dominant, then become targets
	- decline - something disrupts the firm. maybe a failure of reputation, maybe technological innovation, maybe just being out-competed.
- this is really similar to the [[technology adoption curve]]!
