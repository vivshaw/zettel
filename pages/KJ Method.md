- a method of research in which you write all the individual facts, opinions, observations, events, etc. onto notecards, and then group them by physically arranging them in space. as you group and categorize, patterns and explanations start to emerge.

- this later became commonly used in the design world under the name **affinity mapping**
- commonly, this is combined with an element of voting, where the same folks who participated in creating the observations vote on which groupings are most important
- a great tool for [[convergent thinking]], that can be used as a followup to divergent methods like [[brainstorming]]
