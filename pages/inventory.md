- Types of inventory:
	- Raw materials (both _really_ raw and "purchased finished") -> Works in process-> Finished Goods
- How do we account for identical inventory with mixed cost? Suppose you bought 1000 units for $10 and 1000 units for $12. Two accounting options:
	- FIFO- use up the cheaper ones first
	- LIFO- use up the cheaper ones last
	- A company must pick _one_ and follow it consistently!
