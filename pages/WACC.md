- the **weighted average cost of capital** is used to calculate a company's [[discount rate]]
- for projects funded with loans or bonds, the cost of capital is a weighted average of the interest rates on those assets
- for projects funded from retained profits, the cost of capital is tied to *the investor's expected rate of return*:
	- $i_{expected}= R_{rf} + \beta(R_m - R_{rf})$
		- where
			- $i_{expected}$ is the investors' expected rate of return
			- $r_{rf}$ is the risk-free rate of return (i.e., a short term gov't bond)
			- $r_m$ is the average return of the stock market
			- $\beta$ is [[beta (Î²) (finance)]], a measure of the risk associated with the company relative to the whole stock market
	- ...and whaddaya know, that's just [[CAPM]]!
- **what about taxes?** interest payments are tax-deductible, so we need to adjust interest payments for the corporate tax rate:
	- $i_{AfterTax} = i_{BeforeTax} (1 - TaxRate)$
- e.g., a company with a capital structure like so, and corporate tax of 21%:
	- | Financing Type | Amount | Cost of capital | After-tax Cost of Capital |
	  | --- | --- | --- | ---|
	  | Equity | $60M | 12% | 12%|
	  | Bonds | $40M | 6% | 4.79% |
	  | Loans | $20M | 8% | 6.32% |
	  | Total | $120M | | |
	- would have a WACC of **8.6%**.
