- https://vivsha.ws, my webbed site
- time for a redesign, i think. i know exactly enough about #design to know that I'm not very good at it ðŸ˜…
- thinking about look & feel:
	- i want to be more minimalist and more typographic. 90% of the space and graphics on my site currently are Pointless. the site should not contain pointless things. text is fine and good.
	- first inclination is something similar to [Context (Super theme)](https://context.super.site/)
		- but with plain black & white colors, for actually readable contrast
		- and... [the blog page layout](https://context.super.site/blog/think) has super poor readability. need a better idea
			- maybe consider something like [Aeon's layout](https://aeon.co/essays/is-it-possible-to-hold-truly-contradictory-beliefs-together)? that's super legible
			- or [Epoche](https://epochemagazine.org/65/section-23-the-berkeleian-unconscious-marx/)- the article layout here is quite nice!
- thinking about typefaces:
	- i want a serif as my core typeface, ideally something both very legible _and_ with oodles of unique character
		- [Academica](https://www.stormtype.com/families/academica) is a rather nice serif. I particularly like the angular italic.
		- on balance, i might like [Canela](https://commercialtype.com/catalog/canela) better, esp. now that it has book faces
		- if i'm not committed yet to buying, could start with [Orpheus](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/orpheus) as I've got adobe
		- there's [Tobias](https://displaay.net/typeface/tobias/) as well, which I've recently discovered and is _quite_ nice
		- ended up on MB Type's Equity
	- do i even need a sans? I'm not sure that I do. could go with just one typeface
		- i _love_ love [Agrandir](https://pangrampangram.com/products/agrandir), would be cool to have an excuse to use it
		- ended up on MB Type's Concourse
- color palette? green scale?

	- no, let's stay on primarily black & white for now. I'm not good enough at tuning color palettes to make this look better than the existing color scheme.
	- look at this though, _so_ good: https://www.grovelust.be/
