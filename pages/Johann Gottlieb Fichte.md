- Fichte held that what we can know immediately is the subject, the I, and all other knowledge derives from it. the Ego is the Absolute.
	- think of it as perhaps a more radical spin on [[Descartes]], influenced by [[Kant]]'s [[transcendental idealism]]
- **I = I**
	- the subject is identical to itself, and cannot recognize anything outside itself as having truth or validity
	- there is a unity of consciousness with its representations. the world is determined by the representations of the subject. I recognize that there are things in the world separate from me, but also that they are an extension of myself
