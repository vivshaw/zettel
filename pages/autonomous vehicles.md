- levels of autonomy:
	- **1** - the driver can delegate either steering or acceleration/deceleration to the system. the system performs a single driving task.
	- **2** - the driver can delegate several functions, but must permanently monitor the system.
	- **3** - the vehicle can autonomously driver on defined routes. the driver does not need to maintain full attention, but must be ready to retake full control.
	- **4** - the driver can transfer complete control, but can take control if desired. the system can perform any driving task.
	- **5** - there is no driver, the vehicle drives autonomously in all conditions
