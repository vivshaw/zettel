- experimentally, distancing from oneself can lead to higher executive function and better decisions
- could be as simple as speaking to oneself in the third person. or as elaborate as consructing an [[alter ego]]- Bruce Wayne's Batman, Beyonce's Sash Fierce
- in some ways, ties into visioning and the [[ideal self]]. perhaps your alter ego is your "better self". in other ways distinct- you have to detach the alter ego from yourself.
	- perhaps creating a good [[vision statement]] is an exercise in self-distancing at the team or company level?
- not as odd or uncommon as it sounds- [[What Would Jesus Do?]] is a popular form of self-distancing from American culture
