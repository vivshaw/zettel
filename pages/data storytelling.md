- to make results stick, they should be:
	- simple
	- concrete
	- credible
- the 3-minute story:
	- what narrative could I put together in only 3 minutes?
- the big idea:
	- how would I boil my result down into a single sentence?
- constructing a narrative:
	- avoid disconnected facts. stick to your central insight.
	- understand your audience and the background, and provide just the context they need to understand your message
		- what do they know already?
		- what do they _need_ to know?
	- it's easier for customers to remember an anecdote than a z-score!
	- focus on impact rather than process
	- what sorts of data might help construct a narrative?
		- change over time
		- clustering
		- comparison
		- correlation
	- background:
		- what motivated the analysis? what changed? what is the focus?
	- insights:
		- what contributed to the answer?
	- climax:
		- what would happen if nothing changed?
	- next steps:
		- recommend solutions to avoid the negative outcome you revealed
- combine data, narrative, and visuals for the best results
	- data must be accurate, relevant, and reliable. it should provide actionable insights
	- narrative should be compelling, easy to understand, and stripped to essentials. it should motivate action
