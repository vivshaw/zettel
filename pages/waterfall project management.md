tags:: project management

- aka "traditional" or "predictive" project management. the plans drive the project forward. started as a discipline in the 1950s.
- works best when the needs and requirements are known up-front, activities have a strict sequence, and changes are rare
- for example: building a major bridge
- **the stages of traditional PM:**
	- **initiate**- establish the goal, define the objectives, list the risks and obstacles
	- **plan**- identify project activities, estimate duration, determine the necessary resources, create a project plan
	- **execute**- carry out the plan, recruit & organize the team, distribute information, schedule & document work
	- **monitor & control**- control scope, control cost, control quality, establish progress reports, revise plan if needed
	- **closing**- get client acceptance, close out the contract, issue a final report, make recommendations & share lessons
- common tools:
	- [[Gantt chart]]
- how to achieve [[quality]]:
	- PM triangle: imagine a triangle with time, cost, and scope at the vertices. quality is found at the equilibrium.
	- continuous quality management and process quality management can help as the project rolls on
