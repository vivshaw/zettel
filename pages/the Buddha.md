- born Siddhartha Gautama, a prince in the Shakyamuni clan, around 500 BC near Lumbini
- he had a sheltered upbringing in a palace, surrounded by pleasures and joys, where the suffering of the world was hidden away
- he felt stifled by this limited environment, and eventually convinced a chariot driver to take him outside. it was his first time seeing the old, the sick, and the dead. he could no longer ignore the suffering of the world. and so he left the palace, leaving everything behind, to become a begging ascetic
