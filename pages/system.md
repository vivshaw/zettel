- per [[INCOSE]]:
	- > A system is a construct or collection of different elements that together produce results not obtainable by the elements alone.
- per the DOD:
	- > A system is an aggregation of system elements and enabling system elements to achieve a given purpose or provide a needed capability.
- common characteristics of systems:
	- a system is something made of integrated parts, with interfaces, boundaries, and relationships as key parts of the system
	- a system is likely a team effort, probably even multi-team!
	- a system generally has some defined purpose or capabilities
	- a system can help us conceptualize and deal with complexity
- we could think of something as simple as a stapler as a system. it has various parts that need to work together. but it's not very *interesting*- staplers are rather simple! we'd find the system perspective much more illuminating with a more complex system, like a research facility, or a battleship, or an ecosystem.
- concepts we might think of:
	- internal and external components
	- boundary conditions
	- inputs and outputs
	- open or closed systems
	- whole vs. parts
	- feedback
	- homeostasis and self-regulation
- a system is a perspective! it's a conceptual lens we apply to help us understand the world.
- there can be both physical and conceptual systems, or physical and conceptual components of a given system. *meaning* is part of any sociotechnical system!
- systems can be closed or open. [[entropy]], in closed systems, increases. but most of the systems we think about are open. so they are able to decrease entropy locally, by increasing it elsewhere outside the system
- systems can occur in nature! a living body is a system.
- systems thinking is inherently [[holistic]], since we think of the system as having something to it above and beyond the individual components.
- systems are applicable in many disciplines. they tie in to [[ecology]], [[general systems theory]], 
  [[cybernetics]], [[systems engineering]], [[sociology]], and more.
- a typology of systems, from INCOSE:
	- a **physical system** is made out of matter and energy.
	- a **conceptual system** are made out of information. they're arrangements that exhibit meaning which the constituent parts do not.
	- a **closed system** is completely isolated from its environment
	- an **open system** can exchange [[information]], energy, or matter with the external environment
	- a **natural system** occurs without human intervention
	- an **artificial system** was created by humans
	- a **hybrid system** has both natural and artificial elements
	- an **engineered system** is a system created through [[systems engineering]]
	- a **viable system** is an open system that, within certain environmental limits, can sustain itself in the face of threats and maintain [[homeostasis]]
	- a **self-replicating system** is an open system that can reproduce itself.
	- a [[complex system]] has non-trivial relationships between cause and effect. they're not fully knowable or deterministic.
	- An **anticipatory system** has a model of itself and its environment and a decisionmaking system, allowing it to predict and adjust to environment change
