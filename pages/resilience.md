- what is **resilience**? we get different applications of the idea in different fields:
	- > The intrinsic ability of a system to adjust its functioning prior to, during, and following changes or disturbances, so that it can sustain required operations under both expected and unexpected conditions.
	  — Hollnagel 2014
	- > The capacity to absorb shock, return to homeostasis, or re-organize.
	  — Reid & Botterill 2013
	- from engineering:
		- time to return to a steady state
		- complex, adaptive system-continuous adjustment
		- > The resilience of a system is defined by the abilities to respond to the actual, to monitor the critical, to anticipate the potential, and to learn from the factual.
		  — Hollnagel 2014
	- from ecology:
		- > [...] the magnitude of disturbance that can be absorbed before the system redefines its structure by changing the variables and processes that control behavior.
		  — Gunderson 2000
	- from the sciences:
		- > The ability to prepare and plan for, absorb, recover from or more successfully adapt to actual or potential adverse events.
