- the first database model, from the 1960s
- stores data in a tree structure. each record can have many children, can only have one parent
	- similar in some ways to an [[XML]] document!
- used in [[IBM]]'s [[IMS]] database
- lost popularity because highly inflexible
- still in use in some places! banks still use IMS, [[Windows Registry]] is also heirarchical!
