- when analyzing [[dispersion]], we can use a technique much like we would in the [[one-way fixed effects ANOVA]] for means, but on an appropriate measure of dispersion instead of the variance:
	- [[mean absolute deviation]] if populations are [[normally distributed]]
	- if they aren't, [[median absolute deviation]] (for $n <= 10$) or ADM(n-1) (for $n > 10$)
- if sample sizes are uneven, we'll use [[Welch's ANOVA]]
