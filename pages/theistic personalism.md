- quite common in Western Christianity
- > Theistic personalism simpliciter (TPS): there exists a person, P, such that, P
  essentially possesses the maximal-person properties (i.e., omnipotence, omniscience,
  and omnibenevolence) simultaneously.
	- from the mouths of theists...
		- > I take the proposition ‘God exists’ (and the equivalent proposition ‘There is a God’) to
		  be logically equivalent to ‘there exists necessarily a person without a body (i.e. a
		  spirit) who necessarily is eternal, perfectly free, omnipotent, omniscient, perfectly
		  good, and the creator of all things’. I use ‘God’ as the name of the person picked out
		  by this description (Swinburne, 2004 p.7).
		- > Now central to the great monotheistic religions—Christianity, Judaism, Islam—is the
		  thought that there is such a person as God: a personal agent who has created the world
		  and is all-powerful, all-knowing, and perfectly good. I take naturalism to be the
		  thought that there is no such person as God, or anything like God. Naturalism is
		  stronger than atheism: you can be an atheist without rising to the full heights (sinking
		  to the lowest depths?) of naturalism; but you can’t be a naturalist without being an
		  atheist (Plantinga, 2011 p.ix).

		- > My claim is that the idea of God … the fairly specific and detailed idea of an allpowerful, all-knowing, all-good and all-loving creator of the universe, represents one
		  way in which the broader idea of ultimism can be filled out, a way that utilises the
		  concept of a person. Theism gives to ultimism a face, one might say (quite a familiar one). Another way of putting it is to say that theism is an elaborated or personal version
		  of ultimism. You could also turn the point into an equation: theism = personal ultimism
		  (Schellenberg, 2015 p.20).
