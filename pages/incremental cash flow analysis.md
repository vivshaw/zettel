- how can we assess a project that is costs only? for example, a cost reduction project, rather than a revenue-generating one.
- we can't use [[NPV]]- it will be negative! or [[IRR]]- it won't exist!
- instead, we:
	- determine the costs of the "as-is" case, if we don't do the project
	- determine the costs of the "to-be" case, if we do the project
	- subtract the "to-be" cash flows from the "as-is" cash flows. this gets us the **incremental cash flows**
	- now, perform a regular ol' [[discounted cash flow analysis]] on the incremental flows.
- cash flows to consider when valuing a project:
	- after-tax cash flows from operations
		- [[EBIT]] + [[depreciation]] - Taxes
	- cash flows from [[NWC]]
		- use delta NWC
	- [[CAPEX]]
