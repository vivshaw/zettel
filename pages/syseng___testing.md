- **testing** is a task intended to gather information on the system's features and operation in a controlled, traceable environment. ideally, it should give us quantitative data as a result.
	- we might accompany a test with some [[syseng/analysis]]
	- there are two purposes to any given test:
		- verifying requirements
		- reducing risk
- the whole team should be involved in the testing process, not just the systems engineer!
- it's beneficial to test as early as possible, if you're able. this lets you eliminate risk early, instead of at the end of the process
- testing can be time-consuming & expensive. how can we keep it under control while maintaining safety?
	- weigh our risk appetite. how thoroughly we test might depend on how big the consequences are for a miss!
	- figure out what can be done using [[syseng/analysis]] of a model, and what truly needs a test
	- try [[rapid prototyping]], if applicable
	- at each sub-component level, test only what **needs** to be tested at that low a level. then lean on higher-level system tests for the rest.
- two main categories of test:
	- **developmental test** - done for [[syseng/verification]]
		- test is done throughout the development process, possibly in a lab environment, and usually by a specialized engineer
	- **operational test** - done for [[syseng/validation]]
		- test is done one the system is produced, in realistic conditions, and performed by typical users
- other types:
	- **qualification testing**
		- the most hardcore form of testing, and the "graduation event" for the testing process.
		- cover all the worst-case environments and events the system might operate in. might even include unique conditions like radioactive environments, EM interference, testing in water or other liquids...
		- test _everything_, comprehensively
		- once this is done, you should freeze future design changes. if you change the design, you probably need to retest.
	- **environmental stress screening** (ESS)
		- performed on every unit, to attempt to screen out defects before delivery
		- often something like vibration or thermal testing
		- need to balance the thoroughness of the test, with the portion of the system's life consumer in the test!
	- **highly accelerated life test** (HALT)
		- a failure test. go ahead and break it! see what happens when the system wears out.
		- usually, something like vibration or thermal tests taken to an extreme level
	- **highly accelerated stress test** (HAST)
		- another failure test like HALT, this time with corrosion
	- **proof of life** (POL) or **highly accelerated stress screening** (HASS)
		- test to estimate how long the system will last. repeat a cycle of ESS tests over and over
	- **acceptance testing**
		- the minimal set of tests to demonstrate that the system is acceptable for operational use
		- we'll probably repeat this many times, so we want to keep it minimal! some things will only be tested in qualification testing. other things will be tested here.
- tests for particularly complex systems may require planning years in advance!
