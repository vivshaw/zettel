- **Foreward/Intro**
	- this book dispels the myth that there's a tradefoff between speed and safety.
		- it shows a path to get an organization from "deploying once in a while" to "deploying multiple times per day"
		- this doesn't just make the engineers happy- it has real business value! it lets you explore the market, respond to problems, and release new features faster.
		- _and_, it's correlated with quicker recovery from outages.
	- it's not one-size-fits-all, and there are common traps you'll fall into if you try that
		- instead, you need to move to outcome-based team structures. e.g. [[OKR]]s
	- this only works if there's senior leadership support. with actions as well as words
- # Part 1: What We Found
- **Ch. 1: Accelerate**
	- "business as usual" isn't good enough. we need to accelerate delivery of value to the custojmer- in the form of goods and services, market engagement to detect demand, anticipation of regulatory changes, risk response...
	- in the modern world, software is at the core of this
	- the practices developed by the [[devops]] movement are what this book will address and measure
	- **focus on capabilities, not maturity.**
		- > The key to successful change is measuring and understanding the right things with a focus on capabilities [...]
		  (p. 31)
	- why are maturity models bad?
		- maturity models are about arriving at a final state and being "done". but businesses should aim for [[continuous improvement]]
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- maturity models are often a linear, one-size-fits-all formula. that doesn't track the diversity of real-world business.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- maturity models don't care about outcomes. but we _should_- we should be measuring what matters to us, then figuring out what levers to pull (capabilities) to influence it
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- maturity models judge by a static level of tech progress. but tech is not static!
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- we should use evidence to guide our efforts!
		- technology age, whether ops or dev team deploy, and whether a change approval board exists are all often cited as making a difference, but empirically they don't!
		- this book finds 24 empirically-supported capabilities to build. that's what the rest of the book is about!
