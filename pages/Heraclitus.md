- lived in [[Ephesus]]
- referred to by the ancients as the Riddler, or Heraclitus the Obscure. he wrote largely in fragmentary, paradoxical statements
- > The *logos* I speak of is something nobody understands, even after they hear it.
- taught that reality was both a unity _and_ a multiplicity
- taught the unity of opposites:
	- > The road up is the road down.
	- > Seawater, necessary for fish, poisonous for humans.
- the interpretation of Heraclitus as believing all things were in flux, changing constantly, the nemesis of [[Parmenides]] is not accurate! Plato wrote as though this were true, and followers of Heraclitus contemporary with Plato _did_ believe this. but it's not an accurate summary of Heraclitus' beliefs
- chose fire as the fundamental element of his cosmology
	- > All things are exchanged with fire, and fire with all things, like goods for gold, and gold for goods.
	- related to [[Anaximander]]'s idea that "all things pay retribution to one another"
