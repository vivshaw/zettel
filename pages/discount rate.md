- in corporate finance, also called "cost of capital", "hurdle rate", or "minumum acceptable rate of return" (MARR)
	- differs from company to company! companies with high R&D expenses might need higher returns to justify 'em. companies in competitive markets (e.g. commodities) might have to live with a low MARR, since they don't have much pricing power
- similar in many ways to [[interest]] rate
