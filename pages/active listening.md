- active listening is a five-step process:
	- first, we should hear.
	- second, seek to eliminate distraction. filter out what's not relevant.
	- third, try to truly understand, which requires not just hearing but starting to analyze
	- fourth, remember the key points, so that you can build on them when you respond
	- fifth, separate fact from opinion. by factoring out bias (by yours and the other's!), you can both get closer to the truth, and closer to understanding their meaning.
