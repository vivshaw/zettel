- top-down estimate- use historical data to get a rough back-of-the-envelope estimate
- bottom-up estimates- break the project into small pieces, estimate their costs, and sum them
	- e.g., use the [[WBS]]
- ⚠️there's a tradeoff between accuracy of the estimate and cost of the estimate! Rough, order-of-magnitude estimates are quicker and cheaper to produce than a detailed WBS-based breakdown
- also consider the phase of your project- you need less detail and accuracy toward the beginning, but more toward the end
- techniques of estimation:
	- **unit method**- estimate a single unit cost, and multiply by units
	- **factor method**- construct a more detailed cost equation, with multiple factors
		- basically, break the system into components, then do a sum of unit costs for each component
	- **index method**- use an estimate from a prior year, indexed to cost changes over time
		- you can weight an average of indices for an estimate that covers multiple cost components
	- **power sizing method**- estimate equipment cost from a similar, but differently-scaled piece of equipment
		- $C_a = C_b (S_a / S_b)^x$
			- where $Ca$ and $Cb$ are the cost of the two pieces of equipment, $Sa$ and $Sb$ their output, and $x$ the _cost capacity factor_
			- the cost capacity factor represents the equipment's economy of scale. at $1$, cost is linear. if $>1$, we have diseconomy of scale. if $<1$, we have economy of scale.
	- **parametric curve-fitting**- use stats to fit a curve to observed cost data
	- **learning curve analysis**- the more you do something, the more efficient you become. eventually, you hit the steady-state level of efficiency. you can estimate costs taking this into account.
		- **learning curve rate (LCR)**- the % reduction in cost when doubling quantity.
			- in practice, usually between .8 and 1
		- use a [[log-log model]] to make the learning curve linear for easy estimation
			- originally, $T_n = T_0\ n^m$
			- $log(T_n) = m\ log(n) + log(T_0)$
			- now estimate the slope: $m = (log(T_1) - log(T_0)) / (log(n_1) - log(n_0))$
			- by definition of the LCR, let `n_1 = 2\ n_0$, and $T_1 = LCR * T_0$
			- then $m = \frac{log(LCR)}{log(2)}$
