- two types of estimate:
	- **point estimate** - a single number used to estimate an unknown population parameter
	- **interval estimate** - a range of values, such as a [[confidence interval]]
- a good estimator is...
	- **unbiased**. the [[random sampling distribution]] is equal to the population parameter.
	- **efficient**. it has a small standard error.
	- **consistent**. its value approaches the value of its population parameter as the sample size increases.
	- **sufficient**. as much information as possible from the sample is used to estimate the paramter. e.g., the standard deviation uses more values than the range, so it's a better measure of dispersion
