- Frederick Winslow Taylor felt we ought to view management as a machine. he figured we could use scientific principles to determine the optimal way for a factory to run. just as we used engineering skill to optimize the machines in the factory, we could do the same to the factory itself and the workers within it.
- *"The Principles of Scientific Management"* is his most famous work.
- **3 principles of scientific management:** (summed up per Bungay in [[The Art of Action]] )
	- 1. In principle it is possible to know all you need to know to be able to plan what to do.
	- 2. Planners and doers should be separated.
	- 3. “There is but one right way.”
- criticisms of Taylorism:
	- it only works in menial, repetitive environments, where outcomes are predictable. in an unpredictable world, all three premises fail! #VUCA
	- it only works if work remains stable and unchanging forever. but often, management is about the precise opposite, *creating* change.
		- this one's due to [[Peter Drucker]] in the 50s!
	- humans aren't automatons, and don't needs strict control. they'll seek out things they're truly committed to.
		- this one's due to [[Douglas McGregor]]'s Theory X / Theory Y stuff
