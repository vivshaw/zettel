- **Prolegomena**
  collapsed:: true
	- *anxiety* is a central theme of the Confessions, to the extend it changes the writing structure
	- > Augustine believes that human beings are opaque to themselves no less than to others. We are not who we think we are. One of the things Augustine had to confess was that he was and had been himself sharply different from who he thought he was. Not only was this true of his wastrel youth (to hear him tell it), but it remained true at the time of confessing - he did not know to what temptation he might next submit
		- this is an interesting prefiguration of a favored hobby-horse of mine, [[skepticism about introspection]]- which I learned from [[Schwitzgebel]] and took to be a far more recent development!
	- standard readings of the Confessions don't do him justice. we ignore what doesn't make sense to us. or, we try to make Augustine our contemporary. or we propose an "essentially Gnostic reading", where some hidden key makes it all make sense- i.e. the hidden [[Neo-Platonic]] core of A.'s thought
		- it's equally wrongheaded to treat the work as perfect!
	- we have a faulty view of Christianity that hinders our understanding
		- > All parties seem to have agreed unthinkingly on the principle that 'Christianity' is in the first instance a body of intellectual propositions about God and his creatures and about particular events in the history of the relations between God and his creatures. On that view, movement into and out of `Christianity' is a matter of intellectual discussion and assessment, ending in assent or disagreement.
	- what is Christianity _for A._?
		- > For Augustine, and for late antique men and women generally, religion is cult - or, to use the word we use when we approve of a particular cult, religion is liturgy. Anti-clerical Parisians and Protestants may agree that priestcraft is dangerous stuff, but Augustine would not concur with them. The central decision he makes in the period narrated in the *Confessions* is not to believe the doctrines of the Catholic Christians (that is important, but preliminary), but to present himself for cult initiation - and the threshold there is a matter not of doctrine but of morals.
		- > Virtually all late antique cults, and Christianity was emphatically no exception, kept the secrets of their rites closely held. Until 25 April 387, Augustine himself had never seen what Americans may see on television any Sunday and every Christmas Eve - the rituals of the Roman eucharistic liturgy. As a catechumen, he had been admitted to the church to hear scripture readings, hymns, prayers, and sermons, but then he had been politely shown the door when the central cult act was about to begin. In all the years after his baptism and ordination, in all the five million surviving words of his works, Augustine never describes or discusses the cult act that was the center of his ordained ministry.
		- > He surely admitted to full church membership many ordinary citizens of Hippo for whom halting recital from memory of the apostle's creed and lord's prayer marked the upper limits of their capacity to master the verbal formulae of their new cult.
	- we're not gonna delve into analysis of A.'s psychological state
	- structure of the work: 13 books, 9 books at the beginning of biography detailing A.'s path to Christianity, 3 books at the end detailing Geneis, and an anomalous Book 10 about the nature of memory and conscience
	- what kind of work, then, really is the Confessions?
		- > What is presented to us in the *Confessions* is the transformation of the traditional philosopher's ascent of the mind to the *summum bonum* into a uniquely Christian ascent that combines the two paths that Augustine had followed in his own life. The exegesis of a chapter of scripture that fills the last three books itself displays the union of the intellectual and exegetic, the Platonic and Christian, approaches to God, setting a pattern that becomes the center of Augustine's life's work, to be fulfilled only eschatologically - a goal anticipated but not reached on the last page of this text.
		  [...]
		  The *Confessions*, then, present themselves to us a book about God, and about Augustine: more Augustine at the beginning, more God at the end. But Augustine does not disappear in this work. Properly speaking, Augustine is redeemed, and insofar as he is redeemed and reformed according to the image and likeness of God, he becomes representative of all humankind.
	- how are we gonna analyze it?
		- > The method has in the main been to allow Augustine to be his own commentator.
- **Book 1**
  collapsed:: true
	- unlike most of the Latin literature, opens abruptly. begins with a prayer to God, using God's own words. *and the reader is never addressed or mentioned.* like walking into a room with a guy talking to someone who's not there
	- treatment of infant psychology and morality
	- role of triads in A.'s writing and thought- here *modus / species / ordo*
		- A.'s treatment of early childhood language learning later to be quoted by [[Wittgenstein]] in [[Philosophical Investigations]]
	- role of mothers and fathers in Conf. - mothers usually shown in good light, fathers usually God- and when an actual father, usually in poor light
	- all of the standard Latin schools authors of A.'s time are referenced in the text of Book 1 - [[Cicero]], [[Sallust]], [[Vergil]], [[Terence]]
	- infancy and boyhood may, of the six ages of man, correspond to the first two days of creation
- **Book 2**
	- adolescence may correspond to the third day of creation
	- > Friendship for A. is undoubtedly a higher form of association than marriage
