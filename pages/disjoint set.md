- a disjoint set data structure contains a collection of sets that don't share elemnts. each set has a representative from among its elements, which must be deterministics.
- operations that might be supported:
	- adding an element (as a new set, and only if it's not already in another set)
	- finding a set that contains an element
	- union to merge two sets
