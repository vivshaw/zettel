- Western vs. Eastern perspectives on the self
	- the Western self:
		- is like an avocado. there's a pit inside, which is our true core
		- about authenticity to that "core self" and demonstrating its uniqueness
		- we do that through choice. we make choices every day, out of concern with being unique, or of believing that we freely elect to live the way we do
		- strains of essentialism: by sticking to what we're naturally meant to be, that's how we can be a sincere, authentic person
	- the Eastern self:
		- is a "flexi-self", or an interdependent self
		- sure, we are unique, we are different- but why's that important?
		- duty is more important than choice
		- the Western view may not be wrong, but it's constraining and negative:
			- we're beings whose emotions are being pulled out all the time, and those responses can fall into a rut, become an endlessly repeating pattern
			- if you're looking for your "core, true self", probably you're just finding these patterns! but those patterns are contingent, and may not be good for you!
			- if the patterns that make up your self are bad, you should just change them! continually shift yourself for the better, so you can flourish. that's what the good life is- both on the individual and societal levels
				- shades of Aristotle's *eudaimonia*, or Kant's "moral taste"
		- in Buddhism, see [[anatta]]. in Hinduism, see [[Ä€tman]]
