- values:
	- **cultivate openness, autonomy, and trust.**
	- **avoid structure without purpose.**
		- we should only have rituals and processes that truly help us achieve meaningful goals. if it doesn't work for us, it's dead weight, and should be cut.
	- **bias toward action.**
		- when we have a choice between bikeshedding and shipping, I'll choose shipping 100% of the time. I'd rather ship something imperfect and iterate, than get bogged down indefinitely in the design-by-committee zone.
	- **work in small chunks, and iterate quickly.**
		- grand plans rarely survive contact with reality. we don't know the future, nor do we know all our customers' needs. the best way we can handle this is with a sense of humility and purpose- we should break our projects down into the smallest impactful chunks we can, ship them to deliver that value quickly, and iterate frequently as our understanding evolves.
