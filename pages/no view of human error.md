- the view that human error is not a meaningful or useful category. _all_ human activity is variable, _all_ human activity adapts to conditions, and _all_ human activity is flawed.
- it is a category error to think of human activity in the same way as a machine's process
- furthermore, the variability of human performance is predictable! we can use it to better understand [[safety]]!
