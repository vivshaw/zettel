- # Preface
	- author got interested in the diffusion of innovation through agriculture. many farmer delayed adopting profitable ideas for years. why?
	- while studying this, noticed that several other studies of innovation showed a similar s-curve pattern, ranging from seed corn to driver training to new antibiotics
	- this edition aims to both update the theoretical framework, and introduce some new viewpoints. it's also a more critical exercise than previous editions, turning its eye to limitations of the field
	- core concepts to deal with: [[uncertainty]], [[information]], and [[innovation]].
		- innovation creates uncertainty because it is novel, requiring actors to seek out more information to make a reaosnable choice about it
		- this is essentially a peer-to-peer process of social construction
- # Elements of Diffusion
	- > There is nothing more difficult to plan, more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to manage than the creation of a new order of things ... Whenever his enemies have the ability to attack the innovator, they do so with the passion of partisans, while the others defend him sluggishly, so that the innovator and his party alike are vulnerable.
	  Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, The Prince (1513)
	- getting new ideas adopted is difficult, even when they have obvious advantages!
	- an example is adopting water-boiling in a Peruvian peasant village. the local environment did not provide easy access to water, and all sources were unsanitary.
		- let's look at some personality profiles. one profile is a custom-oriented adopter. she boils water each morning, but not for sanitation reasons. instead, because of traditional beliefs around drinking hot water when you're ill. and she's often ill. the right choice, for the wrong reason.
		- a persuaded adopter is next. she adopts water boiling because she came from outside the village, in the mountains, and is worried about the diseases she's heard are endemic here in the lowlands. she is a social outsider, so has nothing to socially lose from adoption.
		- lastly, a rejector. she is unconvinced by germ theory, the truth of which is hard to demonstrate. she has problems that seem bigger and more immediate. and she has an allegiance to the village's regular social norms against hot water.
		- so, diffusion failed! the outreach campaign was unaware of the hot/cold norms. they focused on the custom-oriented adopter (a sickly person) and the persuaded adopter (an outsider). they tried to teach germ theory, which wasn't necessary to know in order to adopt. had the campaign been client-oriented rather than innovation-oriented, they might have done something different!
	- **diffusion** is "the process through which information is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system"
		- it's a special case of communication more generally, because it's about new ideas
		- it's a kind of social changes
		- we'll consider both spontaneous and planned spread of ideas is diffusion
	- **communication** is "a process in which participants create and share information with one another in order to reach a mutual understanding."
		- it's a two-way process of divergence or convergence
		- it's nonlinear, and it might repeat over time
	- **uncertainty** is "the degree to which a number of alternatives are perceived with respect to the occurrence of an event and the relative probability of these alternatives/"
	- **information** is "a difference in matter-energy that affects uncertainty in a situation where a choice exists among a set of alternatives."
