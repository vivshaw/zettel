- how to make decisions when there isn't just one final attribute we care about (e.g. profit)? for example, choosing a vehicle, or choosing where to open an office- non-financial factors are important to both of these!
- instead:
	- identify all the key attributes of the decision
	- assign an importance and weight to each attribute
	- rate each alternative by the attributes. you can use a [[Likert scale]]
	- calculate the weighted average of attributes for each alternative (*Figure of merit*, or *R*)
	- pick the largest!
- to overcome subjective bias, can involve multiple people in the rating and weighting
