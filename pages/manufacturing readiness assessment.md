- similar to a [[technology readiness assessment]], a process for assessing how ready the manufacturing process is.
- there's a huge difference between manufacturing one of something, and manufacturing thousands per day! getting the manufacturing pipeline right can be just as hard as the initial design
- the MRA process should get us a roadmap to get from where we are now, to production readiness.
- at this phase, risk assessment tends to focus on cost and schedule risk, rather than development risk.
- as with the [[technology readiness assessment]], we'll assess a 1-10 manufacturing readiness level
