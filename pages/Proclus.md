- one of the last major Classical philosophers, a [[Neo-Platonist]] in Athens
- [[Hegel]] regarded his Platonic theology as the turning point between ancient and modern philosophy
- he innovated on Plotinus's system of three [[hypostases]] by adding *henads*, individual Ones that exist beyond being, but lead chains of causation
	- he identifies these with the [[Greek gods]]
	- he thinks every henad participates in every other henad
	- the result is a polycentric system, a seeming-multiplicity that is really a unity
