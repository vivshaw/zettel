- takes the idea of [[just-in-time manufacturing]], and extends it by focusing on removing activities that don't add value for the customer, in order to increase throughput and decrease cycle time
- started with [[Toyota]] and their [[TPS]] in the 50's and 60's, but the term "Lean" wasn't coined until John Krafcik called it that in the 80s.
- definition in 5 principles from Womack & Jones' "Lean Thinking":
	- precisely specify value by specific product
	- identify the value stream for each product
	- make value flow without interruptions
	- let customer pull value from the producer
	- pursue perfection
