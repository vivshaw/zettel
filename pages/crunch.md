- you can think of crunch as having various levels:
	- 0. our most ambitious plans are on track. life is great! OKRs aimed at 100%, team has slack
	- We start deprioritizing low-priority objectives. Our plans are mostly on track, but dialling back ambitions. OKRs aimed at 70%, still has some slack. "Cutting the fat"
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- We give up our 20% time. Bottom-up priorities on hold, tech debt investment, new tooling, or long run efficiency investment neglected
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- We swarm on a small number of top-prio/highest-risk objectives, dropping other high priorities. Eng work in ways that don't play to their strengths just to stay on track. Looking at what parts of our core plan to give up. Team knows it won't accomplish all short-term goals. "Cutting into the meat"
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- we pull back on community support to focus on the objective. Collaboration dies. Other teams easily blocked by us. The crunch is now felt outside the team.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- work/life balance falls apart. engineers are working nights or weekends. there's risk of turnover. if we don't correct immediately, we'll have a hard time rebuilding morale
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- ideally, we want our baseline to be 0, dipping into 1/2 but no further.
- it's not a uniform level. this probably starts in individual- or workstream-level pockets before scaling up to affect the team.
- never cross a tier level silently. explicitly talk about when you're crossing the line.
