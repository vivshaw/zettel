- **Problema I**
	- **Is there a teleological suspension of the ethical?**
		- the ethical demands of individuals that they subject themselves to an outside, universal standard. but paradoxically, faith demands that they don't, and puts the single individual above the universal
			- > The ethical as such is the universal, and as the universal it applies to everyone, which from another angle means that it applies at all times. It rests immanent in itself, has nothing outside itself that is its *telos* [...]
			- > The single individual, sensately and psychically qualified in immediacy, is the individual who has his *telos* in the universal, and it is his ethical task continually to express himself in this, to annul his singularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the single individual asserts himself in his singularity before the universal, he sins, and only by acknowledging this can he be reconciled again with the universal.
			- > Faith is namely this paradox that the single individual is higher than the universal.
			- resonates with Hegel's [[Lectures on the History of Philosophy]] & K's [[The Concept of Irony]]'s take on the core innovation of Socrates, and its role in his trial and death, *MoralitÃ¤t* vs *Sittlichkeit*, etc.
		- this is not the same as a spiritual trial, like [[Job]]. Abraham is not a tragic hero!
			- > The tragic hero is still within the ethical. He allows an expression of the ethical to have its *telos* in a higher expression of the ethical.
		- > Abraham cannot be mediated; in other words, he cannot speak. As soon as I speak, I express the universal, and if I do not do so, no one can understand me.
		- shots fired at [[Hegel]]
			- > How does the single individual reassure himself that he is legitimate? It is a simple matter to level all existence to the idea of the state or the idea of a society. If this is done, it is also simple to mediate, for one never comes to the paradox that the single individual as the single individual is higher than the universal, something I can also express symbolically in a statement by Pythagoras to the effect that the odd number is more perfect than the even number.
