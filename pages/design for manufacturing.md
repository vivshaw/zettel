- an approach to design which focuses on manfacturability.
- can we design our products and processes in a way that makes them more repeatable?
- can we identify and design away bottlenecks?
- can we add features that make manufacturing easier? like handles to hold a piece by while working it?
- maximize automation, minimize human touch. also consider make vs.. buy here, and transportation distances!
- think about manufacturability from day 1
