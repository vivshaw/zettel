- > a management structure that standardizes the project-related governance processes and facilitates the sharing of resources, methodologies, tools, and techniques
  PMBOK *(PMI, 2013a, p. 10)*
- a PMO might...
	- develop shared PM techniques, best practices, templates, etc
	- monitor compliance with those best practices
	- document project status & strategy in a central place
	- train and coach project managers throughout the org
	- determine how to allocate shared resources
	- coordinate communication
- goals of a PMO:
	- make sure we're selecting the right projects
	- [[continuous improvement]] of project management practice
	- perform effective resource management
	- evangelize effective PM tools across the org
- there's also the idea of a "program management office", which may or may not be synonymous!
