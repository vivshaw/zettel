- a classic problem in metaphysics: some things are the same- "all the animals in that field are horses". in what *way* are they the same? are there just many particular entities that happen to be similar enough that we call them "horse", or is there some additional, abstract entity Horse, in respect of which they are the same?
- **nominalists** think not- there are universals in language, but not universal things in reality. [[Aristotle]] kicked off the chain of thinking, though he was more properly a moderate realist
	- [[Abelard]] builds the first truly nominalist view, holding that words both *nominate* and *signify*- "horse" nominates every horse (in how they come together as horses), and signifies a common conception of horses. this is arguably a sort of [[conceptualism]]
	- [[Occam]] similarly rejected realism, conceiving of universals as "words in a mental language"
- **realists** think yes- universals are real! [[Plato]] is the original example, but progressively subtler realisms followed:
	- [[Avicenna]] speaks of "horseness inasmuch as it is horseness", particular horses, and universal concepts of horseness. he suggests we should refuse to answer the question of whether horseness is one or multiple. horseness isn't itself a thing- it's a way of viewing a particular horse that discards all the stuff that doesn't matter. yet it is real
	- "material essence realism" was one medieval approach- in which, "horse" is a universal substance, which all horses are, and particular horses are individualized by their accidents
		- some held that these weren't substances, but existed as the horse-ness in each particular horse, or as the collection of all horses
		- [[Boethius]] is credited with this view, though it's unclear if that's really what he meant
	- [[Duns Scotus]] builds on [[Avicenna]]'s view by coming up with a "less-than-numerical oneness" which universals have, and also rejects the MER view of accidents individuating substance in favor of individuators- later to be known as [[haeccities]]
- while the modern formulation is about [[properties]], the classical and medieval formulation of the problem of universals was usually about [[substances]]
