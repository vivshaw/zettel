- concepts:
	- **technique**:
		- > “the totality of methods rationally arrived at and having absolute efficiency (for a given stage of development) in every field of human activity”
		  (Ellul, 1964:xxv)
	- **the technological bluff**:
		- > “…the gigantic bluff in which discourse on techniques envelops us, making us believe anything and, far worse, changing our whole attitude to techniques: the bluff of politicians, the bluff of the media, the bluff of technicians when they talk about technique instead of working at them, the bluff of publicity, the bluff of economic models”
