- measures whether a company can pay its short term debts (time scale of a few months)
- $current\ ratio = \dfrac{current\ assets}{current\ liabilities}$
	- a ratio < 1 is a red flag! the company hasn't got enough cash on hand to cover its needs!
	- but a ratio > 1 doesn't tell us much. maybe the company has stockpiled too much cash, maybe it has large amounts of inventory, maybe it has put too much money into short-term securities... you can't tell from just this!
