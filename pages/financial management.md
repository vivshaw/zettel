	- a lot of interesting number crunching, that...
	- identifies the optimum path among many alernatives...
	- using equations that are not terribly complex...
	- and input values based on historical performance...
	- to make your best estimate of what the future outcome might be.
- [[accounting]] vs. [[finance]]:
	- where accounting looks backwards to keep track of where money went over some span of past time...
	- finance looks forwards, to determine what to do with money to maximize return for shareholders in the future
- the goal of corporate finance:
	- "maximize shareholder wealth"
	- used to be- maximize company profits. but this drove short-term thinking, as profits are reported quarterly/annually
	- advantages: emphasizes the long term, considers timing of cash flows
	- disadvantages: tougher to see the link between decisions and stock price
	- some take the newer perspective "maximize stakeholder value"- including customers, employees, suppliers, communities. esp. those companies interested in [[sustainability]]
