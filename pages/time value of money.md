alias:: TVM

- a sum of money now is worth more than the same sum later
- why? three reasons:
	- **[[opportunity cost]]**. if I had that money today, I could invest it and accrue interest in the time between now and later.
	- **[[inflation]]**. in the future, that money may be worth less than it is now.
	- **[[uncertainty]]**. until the money is in my hand, it's not certain! between now and later, the money might be lost.
- this is why [[interest]] exists. you can calculate TVM using the interest rate.
