# Zettel

This is my [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), built with [Logseq](https://logseq.com/). It's hosted at zettel.vivsha.ws.

## How is this built and deplooyed?

I use the [logseq/publish-spa](https://github.com/logseq/publish-spa) GitHub Action to build the app in CI. I publish to GitHub Pages, per that Action's defaults. Simple as that.
